The Crawl5 system uses a comprehensive 594-line Google Ads compliance prompt that detects:

## üö® INSTANT SUSPENSION CATEGORIES (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
1. **Cloaking/Doorway Pages** - Different content for Google vs users
2. **Malware/Phishing** - Any malicious software or credential theft
3. **Circumventing Systems** - Attempting to bypass Google's review
4. **Counterfeit Goods** - Fake branded products
5. **Dangerous Products** - Weapons, explosives, drugs
6. **Sexual Content** - Adult content without proper controls
7. **Fulfillment Incapability** - Cannot deliver promised product/service

## üéØ HIGH PRIORITY VIOLATIONS
- **Bridge Pages** - Promise products but only show ads
- **Health/Medical Claims** - Medical claims without proper disclaimers
- **Financial Scams** - Get-rich-quick schemes, hidden subscription costs
- **Form Violations** - Pre-checked boxes, data collection without consent
- **Unwanted Software** - Browser hijacking, bundled software without disclosure

## üìä COMPREHENSIVE VIOLATION DETECTION CATEGORIES
The Crawl5 system scans for 11 major violation categories with specific HTML/JS patterns:
1. Malicious/Deceptive Content
2. Prohibited Content
3. Financial Scams
4. Unwanted Software
5. Health/Medical Violations
6. Form & Data Collection Issues
7. Tracking & Privacy
8. Arbitrage/Made-for-Adsense
9. Misleading Content
10. Technical Compliance
11. Political Ads & AI Disclosure

URL: ${safeUrl}

POLICY CONTENT TO ANALYZE:
${safeText}

HTML STRUCTURE:
${safeHtml}

## üîç ANALYSIS TASK

Analyze this Google Ads policy content and identify what changes would require updates to the Crawl5 compliance scanning engine.

Focus on:
1. **NEW VIOLATION TYPES** - Practices not currently detected by Crawl5
2. **ENFORCEMENT CHANGES** - Existing violations becoming more/less severe
3. **DETECTION PATTERN UPDATES** - New HTML/JS patterns to scan for
4. **INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC CHANGES** - Updates affecting health, finance, e-commerce, SaaS sectors

For each change identified, specify:
- What HTML selectors or JavaScript patterns Crawl5 should scan for
- Which customer segments (e-commerce, health, finance, software, SaaS, agencies) are affected
- Whether this requires new violation categories or updates to existing ones
- The enforcement level (WARNING vs SUSPENSION vs INSTANT_SUSPENSION)

}

### FOCUS AREAS:

**For E-commerce sites**: Hidden costs, fake scarcity, subscription traps, fulfillment capability
**For Health/medical sites**: Medical claims, FDA disclaimers, before/after photos, testimonials
**For Software companies**: Bundled programs, system modifications, consent mechanisms
**For Financial services**: Income promises, hidden fees, licensing requirements
**For SaaS businesses**: Trial terms, auto-renewal disclosures, data handling
**For Digital marketing agencies**: Client compliance, ad content requirements

### DETECTION METHODOLOGY:

1. **Identify Policy Language Changes**: Look for new prohibited practices, updated definitions, or changed enforcement language
2. **Extract Compliance Requirements**: Find new technical requirements, disclosure mandates, or consent mechanisms
3. **Map to Crawl5 Scanning**: Determine what HTML/JS patterns need detection
4. **Assess Customer Impact**: Identify which Crawl5 customer segments are most affected
5. **Prioritize Implementation**: Rank updates by enforcement risk and customer impact

Return ONLY valid JSON. Focus on actionable changes that require Crawl5 scanning engine updates.`;
