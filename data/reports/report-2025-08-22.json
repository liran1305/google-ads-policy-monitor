        "content": "Google Ads policies Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the Display & Video 360 help center for additional restrictions. Welcome to the Google Advertising Policies Center Overview of our policies and how we enforce them We strive to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem that's trustworthy and transparent for users, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this help center is to help you build Google Ads campaigns that align with our advertising policies listed below. These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our users and abide by applicable laws. This means that our policies prohibit content that is harmful to users and the overall advertising ecosystem. Our advertising policies cover 4 broad areas: Prohibited content: Content you can't advertise on the Google Network Prohibited practices: Things you can't do if you want to advertise with us Restricted content and features: Content you can advertise, but with limitations Editorial and technical: Quality standards for your ads, websites, and apps To learn more about which policies are included in these broad categories, click the links for the category names to review the content below. For additional details about each policy, click the header of the section to learn more. We use a combination of Google AI and human evaluation to ensure that ads comply with these policies. Our enforcement technologies use Google AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. More complex, nuanced or severe cases are often reviewed and evaluated by our specially-trained experts. We take action on content that violates our policies. This may include disapproving violating ads so they don’t serve, as well as suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and continue to expand a strike system for repeat offenders. We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions we take. If one of your ads is disapproved, you can fix that ad or appeal the decision. You can also appeal an account suspension decision. For these links to work, you’ll need to be signed into your Google Ads account. Note: For DV360 ad disapprovals, learn more about how to Find and fix rejected creatives. You can also Appeal a DV360 account suspension. Prohibited content Counterfeit goods Google Ads prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner. This policy applies to the content of your ad and your website or app. Dangerous products or services We want to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don't allow the promotion of some products or services that cause damage, harm, or injury. Examples of dangerous content (non-exhaustive): Recreational drugs (chemical or herbal); psychoactive substances; equipment to facilitate drug use; weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and fireworks; instructions for making explosives or other harmful products; tobacco products Enabling dishonest behavior Google Ads values honesty and fairness and doesn’t allow the promotion of products or services that are designed to enable dishonest behavior. Below are some examples of what to avoid in your ads. Learn more about What happens if you violate our policies. Examples of products or services that enable dishonest behavior (non-exhaustive): Hacking software or instructions; services designed to artificially inflate ad or website traffic; fake documents; academic cheating services Inappropriate content Google Ads values diversity and respect for others and strives to avoid offending users, so ads or destinations that display shocking content or promote hatred, intolerance, discrimination, or violence aren’t allowed. Examples of inappropriate or offensive content (non-exhaustive): bullying or intimidation of an individual or group, racial discrimination, content promoting hate groups or hate group paraphernalia, graphic crime scene or accident images, cruelty to animals, murder, self-harm, extortion or blackmail, sale or trade of endangered species, ads using profane language, and content promoting the sexual exploitation of minors Prohibited practices Abusing the ad network Ads across the Google Network should be useful, varied, relevant, and safe for users. Google Ads doesn't allow advertisers to attempt to trick or circumvent our ad review processes with their ads, content, or destinations. Learn more about the Abusing the ad network policy. Examples of abusing of the ad network (non-exhaustive): promoting content that contains malware; \"cloaking\" or using other techniques to hide the true destination that users are directed to; \"arbitrage\" or promoting destinations for the sole or primary purpose of showing ads; promoting \"bridge\" or \"gateway\" destinations that are solely designed to send users elsewhere; advertising with the sole or primary intent of gaining public social network endorsements from the user; \"gaming\" or manipulating settings in an attempt to circumvent our policy review systems Data collection and use We want users to trust that information about them will be respected and handled with appropriate care. As such, our advertising partners should not misuse this information, nor collect it for unclear purposes or without appropriate disclosures or security measures. Note that additional policies apply when using personalized advertising, which includes remarketing and custom audiences. If you use personalized advertising targeting features, be sure to review the personalized ads data collection and use policies. Examples of user information that should be handled with care (non-exhaustive): full name; email address; mailing address; phone number; national identity, pension, social security, tax ID, health care, or driver's license number; birth date or mother's maiden name in addition to any of the above information; financial status; political affiliation; sexual orientation; race or ethnicity; religion Examples of irresponsible data collection & use (non-exhaustive): obtaining credit card information over a non-secure server, promotions that claim to know a user's sexual orientation or financial status, violations of our policies that apply to interest-based advertising and remarketing Misrepresentation Ads or destinations that deceive users by excluding relevant product information or providing misleading information about products, services, and businesses can compromise user trust in the Google Ads platform. The Misrepresentation policy strives to ensure that ads are clear, honest, and provide information that users need to make informed decisions. Below are some examples of what to avoid in your ads. Learn more about What happens if you violate our policies. Examples of misrepresentation (non-exhaustive): omitting or obscuring billing details such as how, what, and when users will be charged; omitting or obscuring charges associated with financial services such as interest rates, fees, and penalties; failing to display tax or licence numbers, contact information, or physical address where relevant; making offers that aren't actually available; making misleading or unrealistic claims regarding weight loss or financial gain; collecting donations under false pretenses; \"phishing\" or falsely purporting to be a reputable company in order to get users to part with valuable personal or financial information Restricted content and features The policies below cover content that is sometimes legally or culturally sensitive. Online advertising can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate. For that reason, we allow the promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and advertisers may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all ad products, features, or networks are able to support this restricted content. Further details can be found in the Policy Manager. Ad protections for children and teens Our child and teen ads policies, along with other Google Ads policies (including but not limited to those for alcohol, gambling, and high fat, sugar, and salt food and beverages), work together to provide strong protections that include: Disabling ads personalization Restricting sensitive ad content and categories We require all our advertisers to follow local legal requirements when using our products, including any regulations on advertising to users under age 18, as well as all Google Ads policies. Learn more about our Ad protections for children and teens and relevant ad policies, where they apply, and what they mean for advertisers. Sexual content Ads should respect user preferences and comply with legal regulations, so we don't allow certain kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations. Some kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations are allowed only if they comply with the policies below and don't target minors, but they will only show in limited scenarios based on user search queries, user age, and local laws where the ad is being served. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. Examples of restricted sexual content (non-exhaustive): Visible genitalia and female breasts, hook-up dating, sex toys, strip clubs, sexually suggestive live chat, models in sexualized poses Alcohol We abide by local alcohol laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of alcohol-related advertising, both for alcohol and drinks that resemble alcohol. Some types of alcohol-related ads are allowed if they meet the policies below, don’t target minors, and target only countries that are explicitly allowed to show alcohol ads. Examples of restricted alcoholic beverages (non-exhaustive): beer, wine, sake, spirits or hard alcohol, Champagne, fortified wine, non-alcoholic beer, non-alcoholic wine, non-alcoholic distilled spirits Copyrights We abide by local copyright laws and protect the rights of copyright holders, so we don’t allow ads that are unauthorized to use copyrighted content. If you are legally authorized to use copyrighted content, apply for certification (or here for DV360) to advertise. If you see unauthorized content, submit a copyright-related complaint. Examples of restricted copyrighted content (non-exhaustive): sites or apps that facilitate unauthorized offline distribution of copyrighted content; unauthorized sites or software that capture, copy, or provide access to copyrighted content Gambling and games We support responsible gambling advertising and abide by local gambling laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of gambling-related advertising. Gambling-related ads are allowed if they comply with the policies below and the advertiser has received the proper Google Ads certification. Gambling ads must target approved countries, have a landing page that displays information about responsible gambling, and never target minors. Check local regulations for the areas you want to target. Examples of restricted gambling-related content (non-exhaustive): physical casinos; sites where users can bet on poker, bingo, roulette, or sports events; national or private lotteries; sports odds aggregator sites; sites offering bonus codes or promotional offers for gambling sites; online educational materials for casino-based games; sites offering \"poker-for-fun\" games; non-casino-based cash game sites Healthcare and medicines We're dedicated to following advertising regulations for healthcare and medicine, so we expect that ads and destinations follow appropriate laws and industry standards. Some healthcare-related content can’t be advertised at all, while others can only be advertised if the advertiser is certified with Google and targets only approved locations. Check local regulations for the locations you want to target. For most healthcare policies, if your ad campaign targets allowed locations and the domain is properly certified, your ad will be labeled “Eligible (limited)” and can run in allowed locations. Examples of restricted healthcare content (non-exhaustive): clinical trial recruitment; HIV home tests; addiction services; prescription drug services Political content We support responsible political advertising and expect all political ads and destinations to comply with local campaign and election laws for any areas they target. This policy includes legally mandated election “silence periods.” Examples of political content (non-exhaustive): promotion of political parties or candidates, political issue advocacy Financial products and services We want users to have adequate information to make informed financial decisions. Our policies are designed to give users information to weigh the costs associated with financial products and services, and to protect users from harmful or deceitful practices. For the purposes of this policy, we consider financial products and services to be those related to the management or investment of money and cryptocurrencies, including personalized advice. When promoting financial products and services, you must comply with state and local regulations for any location that your ads target — for example, include specific disclosures required by local law. Advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Below you can find policy requirements related to financial services, personal loans, and certain restricted financial products. As the online advertising and regulatory space continues to evolve, we'll update this policy with additional product-specific guidelines on an ongoing basis. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. Examples of restricted Financial products and services (non-exhaustive): personal loans, loan modification, credit repair services Cryptocurrencies and related products Due to the complex and evolving nature of regulations related to cryptocurrencies and related products and services, we allow certain categories of cryptocurrency-related products and services to be advertised with and without certification by Google in limited circumstances. While most advertisers must be certified by Google, there may be limited circumstances where certification is not required. Examples of cryptocurrency businesses that may not require certification (non-exhaustive): businesses accepting payment in cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency mining hardware, NFT games that allow players to purchase in-game items, like virtual apparel for a player’s characters, consumed or used in a game to enhance a user’s experience or aid users in advancing the game. Examples of cryptocurrency businesses that require certification (non-exhaustive): cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, cryptocurrency coin trusts When promoting cryptocurrencies and related products, you must comply with state and local regulations for any region or country that your ads target. Refer to our non-exhaustive list of location-specific requirements for more information but note that advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Trademarks There are multiple factors that determine when trademarks can be used in ads. Along with the factors described in our Policy Center, these policies apply only when a trademark owner has submitted a valid complaint to Google. Legal requirements You’re always responsible for ensuring that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations, in addition to Google's advertising policies, for all of the locations where your ads are showing. Other restricted businesses We restrict certain businesses from advertising to prevent user exploitation, even if they comply with other policies. Continuous reviews and feedback from users, regulators, and consumer protection authorities help us identify products or services that are prone to abuse. We may limit or stop ads from businesses that pose an unreasonable risk to user safety or experience. Restricted ad formats and features There are multiple factors that determine access to advanced ad formats and features on Google Ads. Certain ad formats are not available for all advertisers until they meet our specific requirements or complete the certification process. Limited ad serving To protect the integrity of our Google Ads ecosystem, we limit impressions of ads that have a higher potential of causing abuse or a poor experience for our users. In these specific instances, only qualified advertisers will be able to serve ads without impression limits. Learn more about when limited ad serving applies and who is a qualified advertiser. Editorial and technical requirements We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users. We've also specified technical requirements to help users and advertisers get the most out of the variety of ad formats we offer. Editorial In order to provide a quality user experience, Google requires that all ads, assets, and destinations meet high professional and editorial standards. We only allow ads that are clear, professional in appearance, and that lead users to content that is relevant, useful, and easy to interact with. Examples of promotions that don't meet these editorial and professional requirements (non-exhaustive): overly generic ads that contain vague phrases such as \"Buy products here\"; gimmicky use of words, numbers, letters, punctuation, or symbols such as FREE, f-r-e-e, and F₹€€!! Destination requirements We want consumers to have a good experience when they click on an ad, so ad destinations must offer unique value to users and be functional, useful, and easy to navigate. Examples of promotions that don't meet destination requirements (non-exhaustive): Display URLs that don’t accurately reflect the URL of the landing page, sites or apps that are under construction; sites that aren’t viewable in commonly used browsers; sites that have disabled the browser’s back button Technical requirements In order to provide an engaging user experience, Google requires that all ads, assets, and destinations meet certain technical requirements to make sure your ads are useful and appealing.

Examples of promotions that don't meet technical requirements (non-exhaustive): exceeding account limits for ads and other content; ads or destination content in an unsupported targeting language; HTML5 ads that don’t function properly or appear blank Ad format requirements In order to help you provide a quality user experience and deliver attractive, professional-looking ads, we only allow ads that comply with specific requirements for each ad format. Review the requirements for all ad formats that you're using. We don't allow Non-family safe ads in image ads, video ads, and other non-text ad formats. Learn more about our Sexual content policy. Advertisers participating in beta programs of new ad formats should reach out to their Google Ads representatives or Google Ads customer support to learn about format-specific policy requirements. Examples of ad format requirements (non-exhaustive): character limits for the ad headline or body, image size requirements, file size limits, video length limits, aspect ratios About our policies Google Ads enables businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network. Google requires that advertisers comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us. Advertisers have a responsibility not to promote content or engage in behavior that risks harm to our users, employees, or the Ads ecosystem. If we see such content or behavior, we may take action, including but not limited to restricting or blocking your ads or suspending your account. Need help?

        "content": "Google Ads policies Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the Display & Video 360 help center for additional restrictions. Welcome to the Google Advertising Policies Center Overview of our policies and how we enforce them We strive to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem that's trustworthy and transparent for users, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this help center is to help you build Google Ads campaigns that align with our advertising policies listed below. These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our users and abide by applicable laws. This means that our policies prohibit content that is harmful to users and the overall advertising ecosystem. Our advertising policies cover 4 broad areas: Prohibited content: Content you can't advertise on the Google Network Prohibited practices: Things you can't do if you want to advertise with us Restricted content and features: Content you can advertise, but with limitations Editorial and technical: Quality standards for your ads, websites, and apps To learn more about which policies are included in these broad categories, click the links for the category names to review the content below. For additional details about each policy, click the header of the section to learn more. We use a combination of Google AI and human evaluation to ensure that ads comply with these policies. Our enforcement technologies use Google AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. More complex, nuanced or severe cases are often reviewed and evaluated by our specially-trained experts. We take action on content that violates our policies. This may include disapproving violating ads so they don’t serve, as well as suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and continue to expand a strike system for repeat offenders. We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions we take. If one of your ads is disapproved, you can fix that ad or appeal the decision. You can also appeal an account suspension decision. For these links to work, you’ll need to be signed into your Google Ads account. Note: For DV360 ad disapprovals, learn more about how to Find and fix rejected creatives. You can also Appeal a DV360 account suspension. Prohibited content Counterfeit goods Google Ads prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner. This policy applies to the content of your ad and your website or app. Dangerous products or services We want to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don't allow the promotion of some products or services that cause damage, harm, or injury. Examples of dangerous content (non-exhaustive): Recreational drugs (chemical or herbal); psychoactive substances; equipment to facilitate drug use; weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and fireworks; instructions for making explosives or other harmful products; tobacco products Enabling dishonest behavior Google Ads values honesty and fairness and doesn’t allow the promotion of products or services that are designed to enable dishonest behavior. Below are some examples of what to avoid in your ads. Learn more about What happens if you violate our policies. Examples of products or services that enable dishonest behavior (non-exhaustive): Hacking software or instructions; services designed to artificially inflate ad or website traffic; fake documents; academic cheating services Inappropriate content Google Ads values diversity and respect for others and strives to avoid offending users, so ads or destinations that display shocking content or promote hatred, intolerance, discrimination, or violence aren’t allowed. Examples of inappropriate or offensive content (non-exhaustive): bullying or intimidation of an individual or group, racial discrimination, content promoting hate groups or hate group paraphernalia, graphic crime scene or accident images, cruelty to animals, murder, self-harm, extortion or blackmail, sale or trade of endangered species, ads using profane language, and content promoting the sexual exploitation of minors Prohibited practices Abusing the ad network Ads across the Google Network should be useful, varied, relevant, and safe for users. Google Ads doesn't allow advertisers to attempt to trick or circumvent our ad review processes with their ads, content, or destinations. Learn more about the Abusing the ad network policy. Examples of abusing of the ad network (non-exhaustive): promoting content that contains malware; \"cloaking\" or using other techniques to hide the true destination that users are directed to; \"arbitrage\" or promoting destinations for the sole or primary purpose of showing ads; promoting \"bridge\" or \"gateway\" destinations that are solely designed to send users elsewhere; advertising with the sole or primary intent of gaining public social network endorsements from the user; \"gaming\" or manipulating settings in an attempt to circumvent our policy review systems Data collection and use We want users to trust that information about them will be respected and handled with appropriate care. As such, our advertising partners should not misuse this information, nor collect it for unclear purposes or without appropriate disclosures or security measures. Note that additional policies apply when using personalized advertising, which includes remarketing and custom audiences. If you use personalized advertising targeting features, be sure to review the personalized ads data collection and use policies. Examples of user information that should be handled with care (non-exhaustive): full name; email address; mailing address; phone number; national identity, pension, social security, tax ID, health care, or driver's license number; birth date or mother's maiden name in addition to any of the above information; financial status; political affiliation; sexual orientation; race or ethnicity; religion Examples of irresponsible data collection & use (non-exhaustive): obtaining credit card information over a non-secure server, promotions that claim to know a user's sexual orientation or financial status, violations of our policies that apply to interest-based advertising and remarketing Misrepresentation Ads or destinations that deceive users by excluding relevant product information or providing misleading information about products, services, and businesses can compromise user trust in the Google Ads platform. The Misrepresentation policy strives to ensure that ads are clear, honest, and provide information that users need to make informed decisions. Below are some examples of what to avoid in your ads. Learn more about What happens if you violate our policies. Examples of misrepresentation (non-exhaustive): omitting or obscuring billing details such as how, what, and when users will be charged; omitting or obscuring charges associated with financial services such as interest rates, fees, and penalties; failing to display tax or licence numbers, contact information, or physical address where relevant; making offers that aren't actually available; making misleading or unrealistic claims regarding weight loss or financial gain; collecting donations under false pretenses; \"phishing\" or falsely purporting to be a reputable company in order to get users to part with valuable personal or financial information Restricted content and features The policies below cover content that is sometimes legally or culturally sensitive. Online advertising can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate. For that reason, we allow the promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and advertisers may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all ad products, features, or networks are able to support this restricted content. Further details can be found in the Policy Manager. Ad protections for children and teens Our child and teen ads policies, along with other Google Ads policies (including but not limited to those for alcohol, gambling, and high fat, sugar, and salt food and beverages), work together to provide strong protections that include: Disabling ads personalization Restricting sensitive ad content and categories We require all our advertisers to follow local legal requirements when using our products, including any regulations on advertising to users under age 18, as well as all Google Ads policies. Learn more about our Ad protections for children and teens and relevant ad policies, where they apply, and what they mean for advertisers. Sexual content Ads should respect user preferences and comply with legal regulations, so we don't allow certain kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations. Some kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations are allowed only if they comply with the policies below and don't target minors, but they will only show in limited scenarios based on user search queries, user age, and local laws where the ad is being served. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. Examples of restricted sexual content (non-exhaustive): Visible genitalia and female breasts, hook-up dating, sex toys, strip clubs, sexually suggestive live chat, models in sexualized poses Alcohol We abide by local alcohol laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of alcohol-related advertising, both for alcohol and drinks that resemble alcohol. Some types of alcohol-related ads are allowed if they meet the policies below, don’t target minors, and target only countries that are explicitly allowed to show alcohol ads. Examples of restricted alcoholic beverages (non-exhaustive): beer, wine, sake, spirits or hard alcohol, Champagne, fortified wine, non-alcoholic beer, non-alcoholic wine, non-alcoholic distilled spirits Copyrights We abide by local copyright laws and protect the rights of copyright holders, so we don’t allow ads that are unauthorized to use copyrighted content. If you are legally authorized to use copyrighted content, apply for certification (or here for DV360) to advertise. If you see unauthorized content, submit a copyright-related complaint. Examples of restricted copyrighted content (non-exhaustive): sites or apps that facilitate unauthorized offline distribution of copyrighted content; unauthorized sites or software that capture, copy, or provide access to copyrighted content Gambling and games We support responsible gambling advertising and abide by local gambling laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of gambling-related advertising. Gambling-related ads are allowed if they comply with the policies below and the advertiser has received the proper Google Ads certification. Gambling ads must target approved countries, have a landing page that displays information about responsible gambling, and never target minors. Check local regulations for the areas you want to target. Examples of restricted gambling-related content (non-exhaustive): physical casinos; sites where users can bet on poker, bingo, roulette, or sports events; national or private lotteries; sports odds aggregator sites; sites offering bonus codes or promotional offers for gambling sites; online educational materials for casino-based games; sites offering \"poker-for-fun\" games; non-casino-based cash game sites Healthcare and medicines We're dedicated to following advertising regulations for healthcare and medicine, so we expect that ads and destinations follow appropriate laws and industry standards. Some healthcare-related content can’t be advertised at all, while others can only be advertised if the advertiser is certified with Google and targets only approved locations. Check local regulations for the locations you want to target. For most healthcare policies, if your ad campaign targets allowed locations and the domain is properly certified, your ad will be labeled “Eligible (limited)” and can run in allowed locations. Examples of restricted healthcare content (non-exhaustive): clinical trial recruitment; HIV home tests; addiction services; prescription drug services Political content We support responsible political advertising and expect all political ads and destinations to comply with local campaign and election laws for any areas they target. This policy includes legally mandated election “silence periods.” Examples of political content (non-exhaustive): promotion of political parties or candidates, political issue advocacy Financial products and services We want users to have adequate information to make informed financial decisions. Our policies are designed to give users information to weigh the costs associated with financial products and services, and to protect users from harmful or deceitful practices. For the purposes of this policy, we consider financial products and services to be those related to the management or investment of money and cryptocurrencies, including personalized advice. When promoting financial products and services, you must comply with state and local regulations for any location that your ads target — for example, include specific disclosures required by local law. Advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Below you can find policy requirements related to financial services, personal loans, and certain restricted financial products. As the online advertising and regulatory space continues to evolve, we'll update this policy with additional product-specific guidelines on an ongoing basis. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. Examples of restricted Financial products and services (non-exhaustive): personal loans, loan modification, credit repair services Cryptocurrencies and related products Due to the complex and evolving nature of regulations related to cryptocurrencies and related products and services, we allow certain categories of cryptocurrency-related products and services to be advertised with and without certification by Google in limited circumstances. While most advertisers must be certified by Google, there may be limited circumstances where certification is not required. Examples of cryptocurrency businesses that may not require certification (non-exhaustive): businesses accepting payment in cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency mining hardware, NFT games that allow players to purchase in-game items, like virtual apparel for a player’s characters, consumed or used in a game to enhance a user’s experience or aid users in advancing the game. Examples of cryptocurrency businesses that require certification (non-exhaustive): cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, cryptocurrency coin trusts When promoting cryptocurrencies and related products, you must comply with state and local regulations for any region or country that your ads target. Refer to our non-exhaustive list of location-specific requirements for more information but note that advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Trademarks There are multiple factors that determine when trademarks can be used in ads. Along with the factors described in our Policy Center, these policies apply only when a trademark owner has submitted a valid complaint to Google. Legal requirements You’re always responsible for ensuring that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations, in addition to Google's advertising policies, for all of the locations where your ads are showing. Other restricted businesses We restrict certain businesses from advertising to prevent user exploitation, even if they comply with other policies. Continuous reviews and feedback from users, regulators, and consumer protection authorities help us identify products or services that are prone to abuse. We may limit or stop ads from businesses that pose an unreasonable risk to user safety or experience. Restricted ad formats and features There are multiple factors that determine access to advanced ad formats and features on Google Ads. Certain ad formats are not available for all advertisers until they meet our specific requirements or complete the certification process. Limited ad serving To protect the integrity of our Google Ads ecosystem, we limit impressions of ads that have a higher potential of causing abuse or a poor experience for our users. In these specific instances, only qualified advertisers will be able to serve ads without impression limits. Learn more about when limited ad serving applies and who is a qualified advertiser. Editorial and technical requirements We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users. We've also specified technical requirements to help users and advertisers get the most out of the variety of ad formats we offer. Editorial In order to provide a quality user experience, Google requires that all ads, assets, and destinations meet high professional and editorial standards. We only allow ads that are clear, professional in appearance, and that lead users to content that is relevant, useful, and easy to interact with. Examples of promotions that don't meet these editorial and professional requirements (non-exhaustive): overly generic ads that contain vague phrases such as \"Buy products here\"; gimmicky use of words, numbers, letters, punctuation, or symbols such as FREE, f-r-e-e, and F₹€€!! Destination requirements We want consumers to have a good experience when they click on an ad, so ad destinations must offer unique value to users and be functional, useful, and easy to navigate. Examples of promotions that don't meet destination requirements (non-exhaustive): Display URLs that don’t accurately reflect the URL of the landing page, sites or apps that are under construction; sites that aren’t viewable in commonly used browsers; sites that have disabled the browser’s back button Technical requirements In order to provide an engaging user experience, Google requires that all ads, assets, and destinations meet certain technical requirements to make sure your ads are useful and appealing. Ads must be clear, functional, and lead users to content that is relevant and easy to interact with. Examples of promotions that don't meet technical requirements (non-exhaustive): exceeding account limits for ads and other content; ads or destination content in an unsupported targeting language; HTML5 ads that don’t function properly or appear blank Ad format requirements In order to help you provide a quality user experience and deliver attractive, professional-looking ads, we only allow ads that comply with specific requirements for each ad format. Review the requirements for all ad formats that you're using. We don't allow Non-family safe ads in image ads, video ads, and other non-text ad formats. Learn more about our Sexual content policy. Advertisers participating in beta programs of new ad formats should reach out to their Google Ads representatives or Google Ads customer support to learn about format-specific policy requirements. Examples of ad format requirements (non-exhaustive): character limits for the ad headline or body, image size requirements, file size limits, video length limits, aspect ratios About our policies Google Ads enables businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network. Google requires that advertisers comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us. Advertisers have a responsibility not to promote content or engage in behavior that risks harm to our users, employees, or the Ads ecosystem. If we see such content or behavior, we may take action, including but not limited to restricting or blocking your ads or suspending your account. Need help?

Maintaining trust in the ads ecosystem requires setting limits on what we will monetize and the behaviors we allow from both publishers and advertisers. Google Publisher Standards cover two areas: Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions. Google Publisher Policies When you monetize your content with Google ad code you are required to adhere to the following policies. Failure to comply with these policies may result in Google blocking ads from appearing against your content, or suspending or terminating your account. Google Publisher Policies are organized into the following categories: Content policies Behavioral policies Privacy-related policies Requirements and other standards Learn more about the policies included in the Google Publisher Policies. Google Publisher Restrictions Publisher restrictions identify content that is restricted from receiving certain sources of advertising. If your content is labeled with an inventory restriction, fewer advertising sources will be eligible to bid on it. In some cases this will mean that no advertising sources are bidding on your inventory and no ads will appear on your content. Please note that Google Ads (formerly AdWords) advertisements will not serve on content labeled with these restrictions. Therefore, while you can choose to monetize content covered by these Google Publisher Restrictions, this content will likely receive less advertising than other, nonrestricted content.

If you fail to comply with these policies without permission from Google, we reserve the right to disable ad serving to your site and/or disable your AdSense account at any time. If your account is disabled, you will not be eligible for further participation in the AdSense program. Because we may change our policies at any time, please check here often for updates. In accordance with our online Terms and Conditions, it's your responsibility to keep up to date with, and adhere to, the policies posted here. Exceptions to these policies are permitted only with authorization from Google. Publishers may place AdSense code on pages with content in scope of the Google Publisher Restrictions, though this content will likely receive less advertising than other, nonrestricted content. Expand all Collapse all Invalid clicks and impressions Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods. Learn more Clicks on Google ads must result from genuine user interest. Any method that artificially generates clicks or impressions on your Google ads is strictly prohibited. These prohibited methods include, but are not limited to, repeated manual clicks or impressions, automated click and impression generating tools and the use of robots or deceptive software. Please note that clicking your own ads for any reason is prohibited. Encouraging clicks or views (non-rewarded inventory) Except for rewarded inventory, publishers may not ask others to click or view their ads or use deceptive implementation methods to obtain clicks or views. This includes, but is not limited to, offering compensation to users for viewing ads or performing searches, promising to raise money for third parties for such behavior or placing images next to individual ads. Learn more To ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, publishers participating in the AdSense program may not: Compensate users for viewing ads or performing searches, or promise compensation to a third party for such behavior. Encourage users to click the Google ads using phrases such as \"click the ads\", \"support us\", \"visit these links\" or other similar language. Direct user attention to the ads using arrows or other graphical gimmicks. Place misleading images alongside individual ads. Place ads in a floating box script. Format ads so that they become indistinguishable from other content on that page. Format site content so that it is difficult to distinguish it from ads. Place misleading labels above Google ad units. For instance, ads may be labelled \"Sponsored Links\" or \"Advertisements\", but not \"Favorite Sites\" or \"Today's Top Offers\". Traffic sources Google ads may not be placed on pages receiving traffic from certain sources. For example, publishers may not participate in paid-to-click programs, send unwanted emails or display ads as the result of the action of any software application. Also, publishers using online advertising must ensure that their pages comply with Google's Landing Page Quality Guidelines. Learn more To ensure a positive experience for Internet users and Google advertisers, sites displaying Google ads may not: Use third-party services that generate clicks or impressions such as paid-to-click, paid-to-surf, autosurf and click-exchange programs. Be promoted through unsolicited mass emails or unwanted advertisements on third-party websites. Display Google ads, search boxes or search results as a result of the actions of software applications such as toolbars. Be loaded by any software that can trigger pop-ups, redirect users to unwanted websites, modify browser settings or otherwise interfere with site navigation. It is your responsibility to ensure that no ad network or affiliate uses such methods to direct traffic to pages that contain your AdSense code. Receive traffic from online advertising unless the site complies with the spirit of Google's Landing Page Quality Guidelines. For instance, users should easily be able to find what your ad promises. Ad behavior Publishers are permitted to make modifications to the AdSense ad code so long as those modifications do not artificially inflate ad performance or harm advertisers. Please see modification of the AdSense ad code for more information. Ad placement Publishers are encouraged to experiment with a variety of placements and ad formats. However, AdSense code may not be placed in inappropriate places such as pop-ups, emails or software. Publishers must also adhere to the policies for each product used. Please see our ad placement policies article for more information. View full ad placement policies. Google ads, search boxes or search results may not be: Integrated into a software application (does not apply to AdMob) of any kind, including toolbars. Displayed in pop-ups or pop-unders, including where a page containing Google ads, search boxes, or search results is loaded in a pop-up or pop-under. Placed inside emails, or on pages where email messages are the primary focus. Placed on screens where private communication is the primary focus of the page. Placed on any non-content-based page. (Does not apply to AdSense for search or mobile AdSense for search.) Placed on pages published specifically for the purpose of showing ads. Placed on pages whose content or URL could confuse users into thinking it is associated with Google due to the misuse of logos, trademarks or other brand features. Placed on, within or alongside other Google products or services in a manner that violates the policies of that product or service. Placed on pages that frame content. Framing content is when a site or app displays someone’s else site within a frame or window without permission from the owners of that content. Site behavior Sites showing Google ads should be easy for users to navigate. Sites may not change user preferences, redirect users to unwanted websites, initiate downloads, include malware or contain pop-ups or pop-unders that interfere with site navigation. Deceptive site navigation Publishers may not use deceptive implementation methods that place ads in a way that might be mistaken for menu, navigation or download links to obtain clicks or views. Keep in mind that every publisher is responsible to ensure that their ad implementation adheres to the ad placement policies. This includes, but is not limited to: False claims of streaming content, or downloads Linking to content that doesn’t exist Redirecting users to irrelevant, or misleading webpages Other types of navigation that is designed to intentionally mislead users Pages where ads are implemented in placements that are intuitively meant for navigation. Technical requirements for web content viewing frames for apps App developers who want to monetize by publishing AdSense and Ad Manager display ads through a web content viewing frame must use one of the following integration options: WebView API for Ads App developers are encouraged to integrate the WebView API for Ads to register WebView instances (Android: WebView, iOS: WKWebView) with Google Mobile Ads SDK. Learn more in the developer documentation for Androidand iOS. AdMob and Ad Manager in-app ads may be shown in an app next to a WebView as long as the Google Mobile Ads SDK is in use and the publisher is compliant with all other relevant program policies and guidelines. As a reminder, content in the WebView is subject to the same content policy requirement as when it is in a browser. Other supported viewing frames: Android: Chrome Custom Tabs and Trusted Web Activities iOS: SFSafariViewController (iOS9 and iOS10 only) Sensitive events A \"Sensitive Event\" is an unforeseen event or development that creates significant risk to Google's ability to provide high quality, relevant information and ground truth, and reduce insensitive or exploitative content in prominent and monetized features. During a sensitive event, we may take a variety of actions to address these risks.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the Display & Video 360 help center for additional restrictions. In this article About the policy Report an ad Best practices Appeal policy decision Google Ads prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods are products that contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner. This policy applies to the content of your ad and your website or app. The following is not allowed: Products described using terms like knock off, replica, imitation, clone, faux, fake, mirror image, or similar terms when referring to a brand name in an attempt to pass themselves off as genuine products of the brand owner Non-genuine products that mimic brand features in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product Examples (non-exhaustive): Non-authentic products that have brand name labels or logos Learn more about What happens if you violate our policies. Violations of this policy are taken very seriously and are considered egregious. An egregious violation of the Google Ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users. In determining whether an advertiser or destination is violating this policy, Google may review information from multiple sources including your ad, website, accounts, and third-party sources. If violations of this policy are found, your Google Ads accounts will be suspended upon detection and without prior warning, and you will not be allowed to advertise with Google Ads again. If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy, submit an appeal and explain why. Accounts are only reinstated in compelling circumstances, and when there is good reason so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest. Learn more about suspended accounts. Report an ad If you think an ad or advertiser is violating this policy, you can report the content through the Google Ads Counterfeit complaint form. Google’s response to a valid counterfeit complaint may include removing the content or terminating the user’s account for this Google product. Google Ads may also document complaints that we take action on by sending copies to third parties or making them available to the public. If your complaint pertains to multiple Google products, please submit a separate counterfeit complaint for each product, using the relevant product's form. Best practices Be clear about your partnerships: If you're an official or authorized re-seller for another brand or multiple other brands, make your relationship clear on your own website and ads. If you reference another brand but you're not an official or authorized partner, consider a disclaimer on your website and in your ads. Use your own branding: Use your own name, logo, images, and brand colors on your website and in your ads. Avoid using another brand’s identity in a misleading way: Avoid using another brand’s name, logo, images, and colors in ways that can trick people. Don’t misspell another brand’s name in your ad text, like “G00gle”. When referencing another brand, follow Google’s policy on trademarks. Appeal policy decision If you believe there’s been an error, appeal the policy decision directly from your Google Ads account to request a review. After confirming that your content complies with policy, your ads will be allowed to serve. If you aren't able to fix these violations or choose not to, remove your ad to help prevent your account from becoming suspended in the future for repeated policy violations. Need help?

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select \"Subtitles/CC\" and choose your language. We want users to trust that information about them will be respected and handled with appropriate care. As such, our advertising partners should not misuse this information, nor collect it for unclear purposes or without appropriate disclosures or security measures. Note that additional policies apply when using personalized advertising, which includes remarketing and custom audiences. If you use personalized advertising targeting features, be sure to review the personalized ads data collection and use policies. Below are some examples of what to avoid in your ads. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. Violations of the policies below will not lead to immediate account suspension without prior warning. A warning will be issued at least 7 days prior to any suspension of your account. Learn more about suspended accounts. Inadequate data security The following is not allowed: Failing to use appropriate security measures for the type of information being collected based on relevant industry standards Examples (non-exhaustive): Collecting numbers for credit or debit cards, bank and investment accounts, wire transfers, national identity, tax ID, pension, healthcare, driver's license, or social security numbers over an unsecured page that is not SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protected and without a valid SSL certificate Troubleshooter: Inadequate data security Fix the ad's destination. Either stop collecting personal information from users or collect that personal information through a secure SSL server to keep it safe. Option 1: Use a secure server. Use a secure processing server (called SSL) when collecting personal information. With SSL, your webpage URL will appear with https:// instead of http://. Learn how to set up SSL on your site. Option 2: Don't collect user data. Change your website or app so that it doesn't ask for personal information when users access your content. Edit the ad. This will resubmit the ad and its destination for review. Most ads are reviewed within 1 business day, though some can take longer if they need a more complex review. Unacceptable information sharing The following is not allowed: Sharing personally identifiable information (PII) with Google through remarketing tags, conversion tracking tags, or through any product data feeds that might be associated with ads Example (non-exhaustive): Sharing user’s email addresses through URLs that have remarketing tags Note: This requirement does not apply to Google Ads services subject to the Google Ads Data Processing Terms. (Enhanced Conversions, Google Ads Customer Match, Google Ads Store sales, Google Ads Store sales (direct upload)) Troubleshooter: Unacceptable information sharing Identify the source. Use the breach notice email provided by Google to identify which URLs are violating the policy. Frequently, PII is accidentally included in URLs that are passed to Google from web forms, login pages, and custom email marketing campaign parameters. Remove PII in shared data. Update your systems so that PII is not included in URLs. Below are the most common methods for removing PII from URLs. Web forms: HTML forms should be submitted with the POST protocol. If the GET protocol is used, the parameters of the form will end up as part of the URL in the address bar. Update the page source or the component generating the HTML so the form tag has method=”post” in the attribute. Learn more about the form method. Login pages: Some sites, especially those with user profiles or user login, use URL patterns that include PII as part of the design. Replace the PII in the URL with a unique site-specific identifier or a unique user ID (UUID). Custom email marketing campaign parameters: Examine the URLs generated by a test email marketing campaign to identify email addresses or other PII in URL parameters. Assign each user a unique site-specific identifier or a unique user ID (UUID) and track the UUID through URL parameters. You can implement a UUID to prevent PII from passing to Google. For example, site.com/my_settings/sample@email.com could be changed to site.com/my_settings/43231, where 43231 is a number that uniquely identifies the account with address sample@email.com. Fill out the response form. Use the form to indicate that you have taken steps to fix the issue. The form helps Google know where you are in the process. Verify the problem is fixed. After you respond through the form, Google will validate that the changes you made to your site addressed the issue. Within two weeks, you’ll receive another notice to confirm that the issue is fixed or let you know if PII is still being shared from URLs associated with your account. If PII is still detected, examine the updated list of URLs that don’t comply with the policy to determine the cause of the issue. Note that you can verify that your changes work on a test site before pushing code changes to your live site. Tag your test site with tags from the same Google Ads customer ID that you use for personalized advertising. Once your test site shows up in the list of URLs where PII was detected, you can make test changes. If we stop detecting PII from your test site, it will drop off reports. Then you can push changes to your live site.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select \"Subtitles/CC\" and choose your language. We want users to trust that information about them will be respected and handled with appropriate care. As such, our advertising partners should not misuse this information, nor collect it for unclear purposes or without appropriate disclosures or security measures. Note that additional policies apply when using personalized advertising, which includes remarketing and custom audiences. If you use personalized advertising targeting features, be sure to review the personalized ads data collection and use policies. Below are some examples of what to avoid in your ads. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. Violations of the policies below will not lead to immediate account suspension without prior warning. A warning will be issued at least 7 days prior to any suspension of your account. Learn more about suspended accounts. Inadequate data security The following is not allowed: Failing to use appropriate security measures for the type of information being collected based on relevant industry standards Examples (non-exhaustive): Collecting numbers for credit or debit cards, bank and investment accounts, wire transfers, national identity, tax ID, pension, healthcare, driver's license, or social security numbers over an unsecured page that is not SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protected and without a valid SSL certificate Troubleshooter: Inadequate data security Fix the ad's destination. Either stop collecting personal information from users or collect that personal information through a secure SSL server to keep it safe. Option 1: Use a secure server. Use a secure processing server (called SSL) when collecting personal information. With SSL, your webpage URL will appear with https:// instead of http://. Learn how to set up SSL on your site. Option 2: Don't collect user data. Change your website or app so that it doesn't ask for personal information when users access your content. Edit the ad. This will resubmit the ad and its destination for review. Most ads are reviewed within 1 business day, though some can take longer if they need a more complex review. Unacceptable information sharing The following is not allowed: Sharing personally identifiable information (PII) with Google through remarketing tags, conversion tracking tags, or through any product data feeds that might be associated with ads Example (non-exhaustive): Sharing user’s email addresses through URLs that have remarketing tags Note: This requirement does not apply to Google Ads services subject to the Google Ads Data Processing Terms. (Enhanced Conversions, Google Ads Customer Match, Google Ads Store sales, Google Ads Store sales (direct upload)) Troubleshooter: Unacceptable information sharing Identify the source. Use the breach notice email provided by Google to identify which URLs are violating the policy. Frequently, PII is accidentally included in URLs that are passed to Google from web forms, login pages, and custom email marketing campaign parameters. Remove PII in shared data. Update your systems so that PII is not included in URLs. Below are the most common methods for removing PII from URLs. Web forms: HTML forms should be submitted with the POST protocol. If the GET protocol is used, the parameters of the form will end up as part of the URL in the address bar. Update the page source or the component generating the HTML so the form tag has method=”post” in the attribute. Learn more about the form method. Login pages: Some sites, especially those with user profiles or user login, use URL patterns that include PII as part of the design. Replace the PII in the URL with a unique site-specific identifier or a unique user ID (UUID). Custom email marketing campaign parameters: Examine the URLs generated by a test email marketing campaign to identify email addresses or other PII in URL parameters. Assign each user a unique site-specific identifier or a unique user ID (UUID) and track the UUID through URL parameters. You can implement a UUID to prevent PII from passing to Google. For example, site.com/my_settings/sample@email.com could be changed to site.com/my_settings/43231, where 43231 is a number that uniquely identifies the account with address sample@email.com. Fill out the response form. Use the form to indicate that you have taken steps to fix the issue. The form helps Google know where you are in the process. Verify the problem is fixed. After you respond through the form, Google will validate that the changes you made to your site addressed the issue. Within two weeks, you’ll receive another notice to confirm that the issue is fixed or let you know if PII is still being shared from URLs associated with your account. If PII is still detected, examine the updated list of URLs that don’t comply with the policy to determine the cause of the issue. Note that you can verify that your changes work on a test site before pushing code changes to your live site. Tag your test site with tags from the same Google Ads customer ID that you use for personalized advertising. Once your test site shows up in the list of URLs where PII was detected, you can make test changes. If we stop detecting PII from your test site, it will drop off reports. Then you can push changes to your live site. Remarketing lists and other lists based on remarketing, such as custom combination lists or similar audiences, will be disabled if they don’t comply with this policy.

Violations of this policy are taken very seriously and are considered egregious. An egregious violation of the Google Ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users. In determining whether an advertiser or destination is violating this policy, Google may review information from multiple sources including your ad, website, accounts, and third-party sources. If violations of this policy are found, your Google Ads accounts will be suspended upon detection and without prior warning, and you will not be allowed to advertise with Google Ads again. If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy, submit an appeal and explain why.

This can include: Creating new websites or accounts to show ads that are similar to ones that were already disapproved Spreading ads that violate Google Ads' policies across 2 or more accounts Using several accounts, either gradually or all at once, to promote products or services for which you lack the necessary Google Ads certifications As part of Google Ads' Gambling and games certification program, failing to re-certify or continuing to use the Gambling and games certification if a material change has occurred since the last certification application was submitted. Material changes are considered to be major, substantial or relevant changes to your account. Google Ads understands that your address or payment method may change periodically. Failing to resubmit your Gambling and games certification application after one of these 2 types of changes will not lead to account suspension. Other material changes do require resubmission of the Gambling and games certification application or your account will be suspended upon detection. These material changes include, but are not limited to, changes to your product offerings that are inconsistent with any license or approvals provided to Google, changes to your compliance with applicable regulations, and changes to your licensure or other compliance with the Gambling and games certification requirements.

Accounts aren't suspended under this policy for having ad disapprovals related to editorial issues like formatting or misspelled words. Circumventing systems: Cloaking Cloaking isn’t allowed under the circumventing systems policy. “Cloaking” refers to showing different content on your website to different people or to Google to try to hide things that might break Google Ads' rules. It's okay to show slightly different content to different people, like showing a landing page or ad destination in different languages, having different special offers, or adjusting for geographical location or slower internet speeds, but the promoted product or service needs to be the same for everyone. Using appropriate click trackers and redirecting users is okay as long as you’re not doing these things to try to hide that you’re showing or doing anything that goes against Google Ads' policies. Examples (non-exhaustive): Showing Google a landing page or an ad's destination that complies with Google Ads' policies while showing people different content. For example, showing sale of clothing to Google when the website sells guns. A pop-up, also known as an “intrusive interstitial” that blocks access to the majority of your website’s content, meaning Google cannot access your landing page or ad's destination to determine whether it’s prohibited Tricking people into clicking on your ad by promoting a topic they’re interested in and then leading them to a website for an entirely different topic, while hiding this inconsistency from Google and its crawlers Sending users to a completely different website that violates Google Ads' policies, even if it’s within the same domain Using click trackers, which are tools that measure how many people click a link, to redirect people to websites with content prohibited by Google Ads' policies Why this isn’t allowed It's misleading: People might see unexpected content that isn’t allowed by Google Ads on your destination, which can be frustrating. It can hide problems: Cloaking can be used to hide content that isn’t allowed under Google Ads’ policies.

Allow easy access: Make sure Google can easily see all the pages on your website (for developers: Google’s common crawlers). Use certified click trackers: If you're using a click tracker, make sure to use one that’s certified by Google. Do a security check: Websites can get hacked and cloaking content can be added without you knowing. You can use the Safe Browsing tool to check if your website is safe (this might not catch everything, but it's a good place to start). Tips for submitting your appeal Follow best practices: Implement the best practices provided if you haven’t already. Explain your situation: Provide details about why you were showing different content to Google than to other people. If there’s been a mistake, share the steps you took to make sure cloaking isn’t happening on your website, like removing redirections or getting certified to advertise restricted content. Circumventing systems: Multiple account abuse Multiple account abuse isn’t allowed under the circumventing systems policy. This means you can’t create multiple Google Ads accounts after getting suspended to try to get around Google Ads' policies or show content that breaks Google Ads' rules. Examples (non-exhaustive): Creating more accounts after getting suspended in order to continue breaking Google’s policies Creating dozens of accounts to run a scam, such as directing users to a fake business that tricks them into buying goods they won’t receive Why this isn’t allowed It can be harmful: Accounts are suspended to create a safe and positive experience for users. It has been used to attempt to evade policy enforcement: Everyone needs to follow the same Google Ads policies. Attempting to use multiple accounts to get around those policies is not allowed.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the Display & Video 360 help center for additional restrictions. Learn more about the “Eligible (Limited)” status. We support responsible political advertising, and expect all political ads and destinations to comply with legal requirements. This includes campaign and election laws and mandated election “silence periods\" for any geographic areas they target. Google has different requirements for political and election advertising based on region. In some regions, election ads may run only if the advertiser is verified by Google. In these regions, election ads are subject to disclosure requirements and targeting restrictions; see below for additional information. Google Ad Grants accounts are not eligible to run election ads or apply for election ads verification in these regions. Check the information under the applicable regional heading for verification and restriction information. In other regions, there are restrictions on political ads. See below for a list of these regions and what is prohibited. There may be additional prohibitions or requirements listed in the legal requirements policy. If your ads contain political content that is not restricted here or by the legal requirements for a given region, your ads may run as long as they are compliant with all other Google Ads policies and local laws and regulations. Non-compliance with our political content policies may result in information about your account and political ads being disclosed publicly or to relevant government agencies and regulators.

See below for how we define “election ads” in these regions and the advertiser requirements that apply.

For example, an advertiser must complete the Australia Election Ads verification process to run Australia Election Ads in Australia. To run election ads outside the region to which the ad content pertains, an advertiser must be verified under either the Election Ads verification or Advertiser verification process for the region in which the advertiser is located. For example, a UK-based advertiser must complete a UK verification process to run New Zealand Election Ads in any region outside New Zealand.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the Display & Video 360 help center for additional restrictions. We want users to have adequate information to make informed financial decisions. Our policies are designed to give users information to weigh the costs associated with financial products and services, and to protect users from harmful or deceitful practices. For the purposes of this policy, we consider financial products and services to be those related to the management or investment of money and cryptocurrencies, including personalized advice. When promoting financial products and services, you must comply with state and local regulations for any location that your ads target — for example, include specific disclosures required by local law. Advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Below you can find policy requirements related to financial services, personal loans, and certain restricted financial products. As the online advertising and regulatory space continues to evolve, we'll update this policy with additional product-specific guidelines on an ongoing basis.

Disclosures increase transparency and provide consumers with valuable information to make informed decisions.

Personal loans For this policy, we define personal loans as lending money from one individual, organization, or entity to an individual consumer on a nonrecurring (one-off) basis, not for the purpose of financing the purchase of a fixed asset or education. Personal loan consumers require information about the quality, features, fees, risks, and benefits of loan products to make informed decisions about whether to undertake the loan. Examples (non-exhaustive): Payday loans, title loans, pawn shops, military loans, tax loans, medical or fertility loans, cash advance loans Not included: Mortgages, car loans, student loans, revolving lines of credit (such as credit cards, personal lines of credit), US Veterans Affairs loans or US Federal Housing Administration loans Disclosures increase transparency and provide consumers with valuable information to make informed decisions. Only personal loans that require repayment in full in 61 days or longer are allowed. This applies to advertisers who offer loans directly, advertisers who are lead generators, and those who connect consumers with third-party lenders. Advertisers promoting personal loans must prominently disclose all of the following additional information on their landing page or app: Minimum and maximum period for repayment Maximum Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which generally includes interest rate plus fees and other costs for a year, or similar other rate calculated consistently with local law. Must be separate from the representative example.

This policy applies to advertisers who make loans directly, lead generators, and those who connect consumers with third-party lenders. Ads promoting high APR personal loans that target non-US locations are eligible to serve.

Learn more about the High APR Personal loans policy. Loan modification To protect our users from deceptive and harmful practices in ads for mortgage-related or foreclosure-related sites and apps, we also restrict certain products and services related to loan modification where the following scenarios would lead to disapproval for Loan modification: Guaranteeing loan modification or foreclosure prevention Charging an upfront fee, unless service is being provided by a law firm Asking users to transfer or surrender property titles, or offering to buy a house at a below-market price Asking users to bypass the lender and make payments directly to the company or other third party Encouraging users not to contact their lender, lawyer, credit counselor, or housing counselor Violations of this policy will not lead to immediate account suspension without prior warning.

        "content": "Healthcare and medicines: Restricted drug terms Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the Display & Video 360 help center for additional restrictions. We're dedicated to following advertising regulations for healthcare and medicine, so we expect that ads and destinations follow appropriate laws and industry standards. Some healthcare-related content can’t be advertised at all, while others can only be advertised if the advertiser is certified with Google and targets only approved locations. Learn more about the Healthcare and medicines policy. Restricted drug terms In most parts of the world, Google doesn't allow the use of prescription drug terms in ad text, landing pages, or keywords. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of prescription drugs or active ingredients that are monitored under this policy. Campaigns targeting Canada, New Zealand, or United States Certain businesses such as online pharmacies and pharmaceutical manufacturers may use prescription drug terms in ad text and landing pages. While you don't need to be certified in order to serve ads with prescription drug terms, you must be certified in order to keyword target prescription drug terms. These businesses must be certified by Google in order to serve ads. Campaigns targeting locations except Canada, New Zealand, and United States You may not use prescription drug terms in ad text or landing pages. Certain businesses, such as online pharmacies and telemedicine providers, may target prescription drug terms with certification. In limited cases, and where permitted by local law, Google allows exceptions to this policy for public health and safety awareness campaigns from governmental or well-established non-profit health advocacy organizations. If you'd like to apply for such an exception to use prescription drug terms in ad text, landing pages, or keywords, learn how to apply for healthcare certification. Restricted animal drug terms For campaigns targeting Canada or the United States, Google restricts the use of prescription animal drug terms when the drugs are intended for animal use and are not prone to human abuse or other misuse. Animal prescription drugs that are prone to human abuse or other misuse are subject to the Restricted Drug Terms policy. While you don't need to be certified in order to serve ads with prescription drug terms, you must be certified in order to keyword target animal prescription drug terms in Canada and the United States.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page.

If you’re advertising financial services on Google Ads, you’re required to comply with our Financial products and services policy and any local regulations for the locations you target. Financial services providers and non-financial services providers are required to be verified by Google if you're running ads or targeting audiences who appear to be seeking certain financial services in some locations. Where required, verification is mandatory for all ad formats and assets. For more information about advertiser types, exemptions, and specific requirements for your targeted location, refer to Financial services verification location specifics. On this page Location specific financial services verification Verification renewal Limited eligibility Categories of financial services advertisers Financial services verification location specifics Location specific financial services verification Some locations have additional requirements to run financial services ads. To target these locations, you’ll need to be verified separately for each location. To learn more about these additional requirements and dates of enforcement, refer to Relevant Regulators and Enforcement Dates. Note that the financial services verification requirement also applies to categories of financial services that may not be regulated by these regulators. The verification process includes providing information about the type of financial services you provide, the licenses you hold for those services, your registration number, and other information about you or your business. Applications for verification must be submitted by an authorized representative. An authorized representative is an admin of the Google Ads account or of the payments profile paying for the ads. This includes advertising agencies, subsidiaries, or other entities that manage the Google Ads account on your behalf. If you’re already certified under this policy and want to have that certification applied to additional managed accounts under the same Manager Account (MCC), you can apply for Manager Account Certification. Eligibility for Manager Account Certification may vary based on advertiser and certification type. Verification renewal You may need to renew your verification periodically. You may also be asked to re-verify your identity if there are significant changes in your Google Ads account like updates or changes to your payments profile. You’ll receive an in-account notification when renewal or re-verification is required. Important: If Google Ads finds that you're promoting financial services after successfully completing verification and that you’ve provided false information during the verification process or you’ve violated our Financial products and services policy, your verification will be revoked with immediate effect and your account may be suspended. We may revoke your verification or take action on your Google Ads account based on adverse regulatory warnings, settlements, or rulings about your business practices, or direct complaints from businesses. Google may update these verification requirements at any time. Limited eligibility If you’re promoting claims management services related to financial products and services, like scam redress services, you must either be a claims management-licensed financial services provider, a government entity, non-profit organization, or legal service provider, or acting on behalf of one.

AustraliaBrazilFranceGermanyIndiaIndonesiaIrelandItalyNew ZealandPortugalSingaporeSouth KoreaSpainTaiwanThailandTurkeyUnited Kingdom AustraliaAustraliaBrazilFranceGermanyIndiaIndonesiaIrelandItalyNew ZealandPortugalSingaporeSouth KoreaSpainTaiwanThailandTurkeyUnited Kingdom About Financial services verification in Australia Beginning on the dates listed in Relevant Regulators and Enforcement Dates, in order to show financial services ads in Australia, including showing ads to Australian users who appear to be seeking financial services, advertisers need to be verified by Google. As part of the verification process, advertisers must prove that they’re licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Note that the financial services verification requirement covers categories of financial services not regulated by the ASIC. To obtain verification, most advertisers will first need to obtain third party verification from our vendor, G2. As part of G2’s third party verification process, advertisers must demonstrate that the relevant Australian financial services regulator directly authorizes them to undertake financial services activities or that they’re exempt from the requirement. When verified by G2, advertisers should apply to Google for financial services verification using the unique third party verification code they receive from G2. Included in the requirement to apply to G2 are advertisers that don’t promote financial services, but that have a compelling reason to target users who appear to be seeking financial services, such as search engines and eCommerce platforms. Likewise, financial services advertisers that are exempt from or not required to be licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), should apply to G2. Government entities with .gov.au domains or intergovernmental organizations don’t need to obtain third party verification from G2. Likewise, third party advertisers whose ads are approved by an AU-authorized advertiser,such as approved resellers, affiliates, and marketing agencies for lead generation, also don’t need to obtain third party verification from G2. Government entities and approved third parties may apply directly to Google. You can review more information on specific verification processes below. Verification is required for all ad formats and assets. Authorized Buyers and Display & Video 360 accounts that engage in financial services don’t need to get verified at this time. Note: Financial services regulators and governmental or intergovernmental entities don’t need to obtain verification from G2. Government entities with a .gov or corresponding domain should apply directly to Google for verification using the Google Ads Financial Services Verification form. Financial services regulators and governmental or intergovernmental entities without a .gov or corresponding domain should reach out directly to their Google Account Manager to be verified. Verification requirements Verification requirements for approved third parties If you’re an approved third party advertiser, you’ll need an AU-authorized advertiser to initiate verification for you by submitting a list of domains or websites that you use to promote their services. When this is done, Google may contact you to initiate advertiser verification if you haven’t completed this verification program before.You’ll receive an email and an in-account notification that will guide you through the required verification process. If you’re an AU-authorized advertiser and have already completed your financial services verification, you can initiate verification for an approved third party using the Google Ads Financial Services Verification form. You can only vouch for third parties whose financial promotions are approved by you. Note: Any time you want to add or remove an approved third party, you’ll need to submit the form again. You must notify us immediately if you cease to approve the promotions of any third party. You’ll be required to submit the following information related to third party financial services advertisers associated with your business. Google Ads account Customer ID Name of the Authorized Representative applying for verification Your Business details (name, address, email address) Domains or websites of third party financial services advertisers whose ads are approved by you Warranty that you approve the financial promotions the third party runs Verification requirements for Non-financial Services advertisers If you’re a Non-Financial Services advertiser with a compelling reason to target users who appear to be seeking financial services, you can apply for Australian Financial Services verification through our partner, G2, using this G2 Financial Services Verification form. When you successfully apply to G2, you’ll receive a unique code which you must provide to Google. Provide the unique code you received to Google using the Google Ads Financial Services Verification form. If your application is approved, you’ll be permitted to show ads to Australian users who appear to be seeking financial services. You’ll be asked to provide the following information to Google in the Australian Financial Services verification form: Your Google Ads account Customer ID Name of the Authorized Representative applying for verification Your business details (name, address, email address) Your business domains or websites you’re advertising on Google Ads Brief description of your business and your rationale for targeting keywords related to financial services Warranty that you won’t use this exemption to run Google Ads promoting financial services Upon review of your request, Google may require you to complete advertiser verification if you haven’t completed this verification program before. You’ll receive an email and an in-account notification that will guide you through the required verification process. Verification requirements for Government Entities Australian financial services regulators with a .gov.au domain are always exempt from Google’s verification requirement. Most other governmental entities advertisers, such as intergovernmental organizations, will be verified automatically by Google. If you haven’t been verified automatically, contact your account representative to request Australian Financial Services verification or contact us. Verification requirements for Regulation-exempt Financial Services advertisers If you’re exempt from or not required to be licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), you can access G2’s third party verification process using the G2 Financial Services Verification form. If G2 determines you’re an Exempt Financial Services Advertiser, you’ll receive a unique code which you must provide to Google. Provide the unique code you received to Google using the Google Ads Financial Services Verification form . Upon review of your request, Google may require you to undergo advertiser verification if you haven’t completed this verification program before. You’ll receive an email and an in-account notification that will guide you through the required verification process. When you successfully complete this verification, you’ll receive a confirmation and email notification from Google. A certificate will be granted to your Google Ads account that will allow you to show ads to Australian users who appear to be seeking financial services. Steps to complete Financial services authorization in Australia Step 1: Complete G2 verification Access G2’s third party verification process using the G2 Financial Services Verification form. The business information you provide during this verification process must exactly match with the business details available on the ASIC registries or records. When your G2 verification is complete, you’ll get a unique code that you’ll need for Google’s Financial services verification form in Step 3. Step 2: Complete or confirm your Google Ads Advertiser verification After applying for third party verification with G2, you’ll receive a status update from Google’s advertiser verification program by email. Follow the instructions provided in that notification. If you’ve already completed Google’s advertiser verification program, you won’t need to complete it again. Step 3: Complete the Google Ads Financial Services Verification form Provide the unique code you received from G2 to Google using the Google Ads Financial Services Verification form. If you’re successfully verified after completing these steps, a certificate will be applied to your Google Ads account. We’ll notify you by email on the status of your request. Advertisers who are successfully verified after completing the steps will be allowed to show financial services ads in Australia and show ads to Australian users who appear to be seeking financial services.

If you’re already certified under this policy and want to have that certification applied to additional managed accounts under the same Manager Account (MCC), you can apply for Manager Account Certification. Eligibility for Manager Account Certification may vary based on advertiser and certification type. Verification renewal You may need to renew your verification periodically. You may also be asked to re-verify your identity if there are significant changes in your Google Ads account like updates or changes to your payments profile. You’ll receive an in-account notification when renewal or re-verification is required. Important: If Google Ads finds that you're promoting financial services after successfully completing verification and that you’ve provided false information during the verification process or you’ve violated our Financial products and services policy, your verification will be revoked with immediate effect and your account may be suspended. We may revoke your verification or take action on your Google Ads account based on adverse regulatory warnings, settlements, or rulings about your business practices, or direct complaints from businesses. Google may update these verification requirements at any time. Limited eligibility If you’re promoting claims management services related to financial products and services, like scam redress services, you must either be a claims management-licensed financial services provider, a government entity, non-profit organization, or legal service provider, or acting on behalf of one.

Australia Australia Brazil France Germany India Indonesia Ireland Italy New Zealand Portugal Singapore South Korea Spain Taiwan Thailand Turkey United Kingdom About Financial services verification in Australia Beginning on the dates listed in Relevant Regulators and Enforcement Dates, in order to show financial services ads in Australia, including showing ads to Australian users who appear to be seeking financial services, advertisers need to be verified by Google. As part of the verification process, advertisers must prove that they’re licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Note that the financial services verification requirement covers categories of financial services not regulated by the ASIC. To obtain verification, most advertisers will first need to obtain third party verification from our vendor, G2. As part of G2’s third party verification process, advertisers must demonstrate that the relevant Australian financial services regulator directly authorizes them to undertake financial services activities or that they’re exempt from the requirement. When verified by G2, advertisers should apply to Google for financial services verification using the unique third party verification code they receive from G2. Included in the requirement to apply to G2 are advertisers that don’t promote financial services, but that have a compelling reason to target users who appear to be seeking financial services, such as search engines and eCommerce platforms. Likewise, financial services advertisers that are exempt from or not required to be licensed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), should apply to G2. Government entities with .gov.au domains or intergovernmental organizations don’t need to obtain third party verification from G2. Likewise, third party advertisers whose ads are approved by an AU-authorized advertiser,such as approved resellers, affiliates, and marketing agencies for lead generation, also don’t need to obtain third party verification from G2. Government entities and approved third parties may apply directly to Google. You can review more information on specific verification processes below. Verification is required for all ad formats and assets. Authorized Buyers and Display & Video 360 accounts that engage in financial services don’t need to get verified at this time.

For example, an agency advertising on behalf of a political party should verify as the political party. Advertisers who were previously verified to run EU Election Ads, and now wish to run UK Election Ads, must reapply for verification with a new Google Ads account that meets the UK verification requirements. Verification for organizations Step 1: Verify eligibility to run election ads You must be an authorized representative for the advertiser in order to complete the two steps of this verification process. Verifying eligibility to run election ads can take up to 5 business days for each step.

As noted above, you must be an authorized representative to complete this step. To verify, you’ll be asked for the following: Organization name Organization address Registration document or number for the organization: You can provide your approved election registration for a UK election; bank, credit card, or insurance statements or letters or leasing or mortgage documents, confirmation certificates from official government authority; receipts or copies of court or other authority rulings or decisions on registrations.

Step 2: Verify your identity Once Google verifies your eligibility to run election ads, you’ll receive an email and an in-account notification (in a red bar at the top of your Google Ads account) that guides you through the identity verification process in Google Ads.

How Google uses your information With the information you provide during the verification process, Google will verify your identity and eligibility to run election ads. For election ads that run in the region to which the ad content pertains, Google will: Generate, when possible, an in-ad disclosure that identifies who paid for your election ad. This means your name, or the name of the organization you represent, will be displayed in the ad shown to users. Election ads run by verified election advertisers in other regions where election ad verification is required will also contain a “Paid for by” disclosure. Publish a publicly available Political Advertising Transparency Report and a political ads library with data on funding sources for election ads, the amounts being spent, and more. For all other ads, Google will: Generate, when possible, an in-ad disclosure using the information provided during the verification program. This means that your name, or the name of the organization or business you represent, and country, will be displayed in a disclosure shown to users. Find out more about Advertiser transparency and disclosures. Make information publicly available about your ad creatives, dates and locations ads served, ads removed and accounts suspended for legal or policy reasons, business contact info, and advertiser name change history, as described in our advertiser verification policy. How to apply for verification You can apply for verification using this application form below. You’ll be asked to complete the steps detailed above for organizations or individuals.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Requirements for verification You can be verified to run Election Ads as an organization or an individual. You're an organization if you are a political party or related entity, non-profit organization, business, or other entity. If you need to be verified as an organization, the “Account type” selected for your Google Ads payment profile must be “Organization”. You're an individual if you are a natural person, sole trader, or do not otherwise meet the criteria for being verified as an organization. If you need to be verified as an individual, the “Account type” selected for your Google Ads payment profile must be “Individual.” You can check your “Account type” in your Google Ads payment profile via the “Settings” page for “Billing & payments.” Note that your “Account type” can’t be modified. If your “Account type” is “Individual,” but you need to verify as an organization, or vice versa, we recommend that you create a new Google Ads account with the appropriate “Account type” setting, before applying for verification. If you’re an agency or someone who manages multiple Google Ads accounts, each individual account planning to run Election Ads will need to apply for verification. You are required to verify the end advertiser, not the agency or intermediary acting on their behalf. For example, an agency advertising on behalf of a political party should verify as the political party. Verification for organizations Step 1: Verify eligibility to run Election Ads You must be an authorized representative for the advertiser in order to complete the two steps of this verification process. Verifying eligibility to run Election Ads can take up to 5 business days. In the application form, you’ll be asked to provide the following as the authorized representative: Your Google Ads Customer ID Email address: The email address used by your organization Name of advertiser: Note this name will be visible in the ad’s “Paid for by” disclosure, as well as in the Political Advertising on Google Transparency Report.

Official address: This must be an Australian address. Attestation that the authorized representative is a citizen or permanent resident of Australia. Attestation that the organization applying for verification is registered or based in Australia and legally permitted to run Australia Election Ads. Attestation that the organization applying for verification has or will satisfy the appropriate disclaimer requirements under Australian law. Agreement to the Google Election Advertising Terms. Step 2: Verify your identity Once Google verifies the advertiser's eligibility to run Election Ads, you’ll receive an email and an in-account notification (in a red bar at the top of the Google Ads account), that guides you through the identity verification process in Google Ads. Verifying your identity can take up to 5 business days. As noted above, you must be an authorized representative to complete this step. To verify, you’ll be asked for the following: Organization name Organization address: This must be an Australian address.

How Google uses your information With the information you provide during the verification process, Google will verify your identity and eligibility to run election ads. For election ads that run in the region to which the ad content pertains, Google will: Generate, when possible, an in-ad disclosure that identifies who paid for your election ad. This means your name, or the name of the organization you represent, will be displayed in the ad shown to users. Election ads run by verified election advertisers in other regions where election ad verification is required will also contain a “Paid for by” disclosure. Publish a publicly available Political Advertising Transparency Report and a political ads library with data on funding sources for election ads, the amounts being spent, and more. For all other ads, Google will: Generate, when possible, an in-ad disclosure using the information provided during the verification program. This means that your name, or the name of the organization or business you represent, and country, will be displayed in a disclosure shown to users.

If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the Amendment on behalf of the Advertiser. The Amendment, in addition to any other Google advertising terms You have accepted, governs Your placement of election ads through Google.

Google has no obligation to provide notice in advance of publication of any information related to Your election ads.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Requirements for verification You can be verified to run Election Ads as an organization or an individual. You're an organization if you are a political party or related entity, non-profit organization, business, or other entity. If you need to be verified as an organization, the “Account type” selected for your Google Ads payment profile must be “Organization”. You're an individual if you are a natural person, sole trader, or do not otherwise meet the criteria for being verified as an organization. If you need to be verified as an individual, the “Account type” selected for your Google Ads payment profile must be “Individual.” You can check your “Account type” in your Google Ads payment profile via the “Settings” page for “Billing & payments.” Note that your “Account type” can’t be modified. If your “Account type” is “Individual,” but you need to verify as an organization, or vice versa, we recommend that you create a new Google Ads account with the appropriate “Account type” setting, before applying for verification. If you’re an agency or someone who manages multiple Google Ads accounts, each individual account planning to run Election Ads will need to apply for verification. You are required to verify the end advertiser, not the agency or intermediary acting on their behalf. For example, an agency advertising on behalf of a political party should verify as the political party. Verification for organizations Step 1: Verify eligibility to run Election Ads You must be an authorized representative for the advertiser in order to complete the two steps of this verification process. Verifying eligibility to run Election Ads can take up to 5 business days. In the application form, you’ll be asked to provide the following as the authorized representative: Your Google Ads Customer ID Email address: The email address used by your organization Name of advertiser: Note this name will be visible in the ad’s “Paid for by” disclosure, as well as in the Political Advertising on Google Transparency Report. Registration number: For example, your Australian Company Number or Australian Business Number (if applicable). Proof of organization: You must submit A certificate of incorporation or registration, GST registration letter from the Australian Taxation Office or party extract from the Australian Electoral Commission if you are a company, partnership, registered Australian body, association, co-operative, non-profit organization or registered political party. A certificate or document from a public, government, or judicial authority, such as a letter of approval from an official body; or a document establishing your organization name and address, such as a bank/credit card statement or a utility bill if you are any other organization type not listed above. Official address: This must be an Australian address. Attestation that the authorized representative is a citizen or permanent resident of Australia. Attestation that the organization applying for verification is registered or based in Australia and legally permitted to run Australia Election Ads. Attestation that the organization applying for verification has or will satisfy the appropriate disclaimer requirements under Australian law. Agreement to the Google Election Advertising Terms. Step 2: Verify your identity Once Google verifies the advertiser's eligibility to run Election Ads, you’ll receive an email and an in-account notification (in a red bar at the top of the Google Ads account), that guides you through the identity verification process in Google Ads. Verifying your identity can take up to 5 business days. As noted above, you must be an authorized representative to complete this step. To verify, you’ll be asked for the following: Organization name Organization address: This must be an Australian address. Proof of organization: You must submit A certificate of incorporation or registration, GST registration letter from the Australian Taxation Office or party extract from the Australian Electoral Commission if you are a company, partnership, registered Australian body, association, co-operative, non-profit organization or registered political party.

Authorized representative name: Note that this must exactly match the name on the government-issued photo ID you submit, including any capitalization, middle name, initial or punctuation. A copy of your authorized representative’s government-issued photo ID: A current Australian passport, Australian driver’s license or Australian photo card. Attestation that the authorized representative is a citizen or permanent resident of Australia. Attestation that the organization applying for verification is registered or based in Australia and legally permitted to run Australia Election Ads. Attestation that the organization applying for verification has or will satisfy the appropriate disclaimer requirements under Australian law. Agreement to the Google Election Advertising Terms.

This name will be visible in the ad’s “Paid for by” disclosure, as well as in the Political Advertising on Google Transparency Report. Address: This must be an Australian address. Attestation that you are a citizen or permanent resident of Australia, and are legally permitted to run Australia Election Ads. Attestation that you have or will satisfy the appropriate disclaimer requirements under Australian law. Agreement to the Google Election Advertising Terms. Step 2: Verify your identity Once Google verifies your eligibility to run Election Ads, you’ll receive an email and an in-account notification (in a red bar at the top of your Google Ads account) that guides you through the identity verification process in Google Ads. To verify, you’ll need to provide the following in Google Ads: Name: This must match the name in your government-issued photo ID.

Attestation that you have or will satisfy the appropriate disclaimer requirements under Australian law. Agreement to the Google Election Advertising Terms. How Google uses your information With the information you provide during the verification process, Google will verify your identity and eligibility to run election ads. For election ads that run in the region to which the ad content pertains, Google will: Generate, when possible, an in-ad disclosure that identifies who paid for your election ad. This means your name, or the name of the organization you represent, will be displayed in the ad shown to users. Election ads run by verified election advertisers in other regions where election ad verification is required will also contain a “Paid for by” disclosure. Publish a publicly available Political Advertising Transparency Report and a political ads library with data on funding sources for election ads, the amounts being spent, and more. For all other ads, Google will: Generate, when possible, an in-ad disclosure using the information provided during the verification program. This means that your name, or the name of the organization or business you represent, and country, will be displayed in a disclosure shown to users. Find out more about Advertiser transparency and disclosures. Make information publicly available about your ad creatives, dates and locations ads served, ads removed and accounts suspended for legal or policy reasons, business contact info, and advertiser name change history, as described in our advertiser verification policy.

Accepting the Amendment You represent and warrant that all information you have provided to Google Australia Pty Ltd (\"Google\") is accurate, and that you are authorized to accept these terms (the \"Amendment\") on behalf of the entity named above (the \"Advertiser\" or \"You\"). If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the Amendment on behalf of the Advertiser. The Amendment, in addition to any other Google advertising terms You have accepted, governs Your placement of election ads through Google. In the event of an inconsistency between the Amendment and other Google advertising terms, the Amendment shall control. 2. Your Responsibilities You represent and warrant that the Advertiser has obtained all necessary rights and, under all applicable laws, is permitted to purchase election ads. You affirm that You are a citizen or permanent resident of Australia, and that if the Advertiser is an organization, that the organization is registered or based in Australia. If the Advertiser is an organization, if the Advertiserâ€™s Authorized Representative leaves the organization or ceases to be eligible, the Advertiser must immediately provide Google with a new eligible Authorized Representative. At any time, Google may require You to provide additional information in order to verify Your eligibility to run election ads. Your verification will periodically expire, and in order to continue running election ads, You will need to complete the verification process again. Where the processing of identification documents is subject to consent requirements pursuant to applicable laws, you consent to such processing. If Google, in its sole discretion, determines that You have provided false information as part of the verification process, that You have violated Google's Political content policy, or that You are ineligible to run election ads for any other reason, Your verification will be revoked, and Your advertising account may be suspended. 3. Paid-for-By Disclosures Where reasonably possible, Google will include disclosures in Your election ads stating that they were paid for by the Advertiser. These disclosures may appear either in the body of the ad creative itself, or may be linked from an icon associated with the ad. In the event that Google is, using reasonable endeavours, unable to render a disclosure, You must include a disclosure in Your own ad creatives in compliance with any instructions provided by Google policy or Google representatives. For purposes of clarification, none of the disclosures made pursuant to this Amendment in any way exempt You from compliance with all applicable law, including but not limited to any disclosure requirements therein. 4. Publication of Information You authorize Google and its affiliates to publish information about You and Your election ads and campaigns, including but not limited to Your verification status, Your spend, Your ad creatives, Your targeting settings, the reach of Your ads, the number of impressions Your ads receive, the dates Your ads served, and the policy enforcement status of Your ads. You acknowledge that this information will appear in a publicly available transparency report and election ads library, and that Google and its affiliates may make it publicly accessible and available for download. Information about any election ad or election ad campaign that serves on or after November 1, 2020 is subject to inclusion, even if You complete the verification process on a later date. Google may also make other information related to Your placement of election ads publicly available as required under applicable local laws. Google has no obligation to provide notice in advance of publication of any information related to Your election ads. Notwithstanding termination of Your Google advertising terms or any selections made in the user interface for the relevant Google advertising service, Google will retain information about Your election ads as necessary to publish the transparency report, election ads library, and meet its other disclosure obligations. GOOGLE WILL PUBLISH ELECTION ADS INFORMATION \"AS IS,\" \"AS AVAILABLE,\" AND \"WITH ALL FAULTS,\" AND DOES NOT MAKE ANY GUARANTEE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACCURACY OF INFORMATION INCLUDED IN ITS DISCLOSURES. GOOGLE MAKES NO PROMISE TO INFORM ADVERTISERS OR USERS OF DEFECTS OR ERRORS. 5. Updates and Termination Google may make non-material changes to this Amendment at any time without notice, but Google will provide notice of any material changes to this Amendment. Changes will be effective immediately upon notice. Either party may terminate this Amendment at any time with notice to the other party, but (i) sections 1 and 4 will survive termination, (ii) You must not run any further election ads after termination, and (iii) Your Google advertising terms will remain in force. I accept the Google Election Advertising Terms on behalf of the advertiser listed above. To be verified as an individual, the “Account type” selected for your Ads payment profile must be “Individual.” Learn more. Full Name * This name should match the name in your Google Ads payment profile (which you can view in the “Settings” page for “Billing & payments”) and the name on the government-issued photo ID you submit in Step 2. Note this name will be visible in the ad’s “Paid for by” disclosure, as well as in the Political Advertising on Google Transparency Report. It may also appear in a disclosure on your non-election ads. Address * This must be an Australian address. Google will use your current invoice setup to verify your Google Ads account. Check this box if you have a pending invoice setup in your account (with a start date in the future), and would like to verify your Google Ads account with that information instead of your current information. Note that if you change your invoice setup after being verified, you’ll have to apply for verification again. Learn more about invoice setup.

In this article About the policy About robots.txt files and related disapprovals Options to fix Google requires that your ad destination and contents are crawlable by Google AdsBot web crawlers to verify that users are led to an ad destination that’s relevant to the ad they’ve clicked. Ensure that Google can crawl your site effectively by using a URL structure that follows URL Structure Best Practices for Google Search. The following would lead to disapproval for Destination not crawlable: Destinations that aren't crawlable by Google Ads Examples (non-exhaustive): Using exclusion files like \"robots.txt\" to restrict access to the majority or entirety of a site Using site settings that allow less crawling than is required for the number of ads you’re running Note: Even if you’re not blocking Google Ads from crawling your content, you might be unintentionally limiting efficient crawls. This is particularly likely if you have recently submitted a large volume of ads to Google. If you use a click tracker for your ads, check if that might be affecting the crawl capacity. If your website doesn’t have sufficient crawl capacity, consider breaking up your ad submissions into smaller batches spread across several days. About robots.txt files and related disapprovals A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. Learn more about How Google Interprets the robots.txt Specification. Common reasons for “Destination not crawlable due to robots.txt“ include: Server's robots.txt disallows access: Your robots.txt file doesn’t allow crawl access, so Google Ads couldn’t crawl your site. Server's robots.txt unreachable or Timeouts reading robots.txt: Google Ads couldn’t crawl your site because it couldn’t read your robots.txt file. Learn more about how to Submit Updated Robots.txt. Options to fix If this policy is affecting your ad, review your options to fix below. Allow Google AdsBot web crawlers to access your ad destinations Make sure you’re not using exclusion files like \"robots.txt\" to restrict access to the majority or entirety of your site. You can use Google Search Console to verify that your pages are accessible. You can also check for crawl errors or a low crawl rate. If you use a click tracker for your ads, make sure that it’s not affecting the crawl capacity. If you can’t resolve the issue yourself, work with your web developer to make your app or website accessible to the Google AdsBot web crawlers. Choose a different destination Update your ads to use a different destination that is compliant with this policy. Edit your ads to comply with this policy Go to Ads within the Campaigns menu. Hover over the ad or asset and select Edit. Edit the ad or asset so that it complies with the policy. Select Save. Your ad will be automatically reviewed again. Check the ad’s status in the “Ads & assets” page for updates. Learn more about how to Fix an ad with policy violations. Appeal policy decision If you believe there’s been an error and that you haven’t violated Google Ads' policies, appeal the policy decision directly from your Google Ads account to request a review. If the review determines that your ads are compliant, they can run again. If you aren't able to fix these violations or choose not to, remove your ad to help prevent your account from becoming suspended in the future for repeated policy violations.

The following would lead to disapproval for Destination not crawlable: Destinations that aren't crawlable by Google Ads Examples (non-exhaustive): Using exclusion files like \"robots.txt\" to restrict access to the majority or entirety of a site Using site settings that allow less crawling than is required for the number of ads you’re running Note: Even if you’re not blocking Google Ads from crawling your content, you might be unintentionally limiting efficient crawls. This is particularly likely if you have recently submitted a large volume of ads to Google. If you use a click tracker for your ads, check if that might be affecting the crawl capacity. If your website doesn’t have sufficient crawl capacity, consider breaking up your ad submissions into smaller batches spread across several days. About robots.txt files and related disapprovals A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site. Learn more about How Google Interprets the robots.txt Specification. Common reasons for “Destination not crawlable due to robots.txt“ include: Server's robots.txt disallows access: Your robots.txt file doesn’t allow crawl access, so Google Ads couldn’t crawl your site. Server's robots.txt unreachable or Timeouts reading robots.txt: Google Ads couldn’t crawl your site because it couldn’t read your robots.txt file. Learn more about how to Submit Updated Robots.txt. Options to fix If this policy is affecting your ad, review your options to fix below. Allow Google AdsBot web crawlers to access your ad destinations Make sure you’re not using exclusion files like \"robots.txt\" to restrict access to the majority or entirety of your site. You can use Google Search Console to verify that your pages are accessible. You can also check for crawl errors or a low crawl rate. If you use a click tracker for your ads, make sure that it’s not affecting the crawl capacity. If you can’t resolve the issue yourself, work with your web developer to make your app or website accessible to the Google AdsBot web crawlers. Choose a different destination Update your ads to use a different destination that is compliant with this policy. Edit your ads to comply with this policy Go to Ads within the Campaigns menu. Hover over the ad or asset and select Edit. Edit the ad or asset so that it complies with the policy. Select Save. Your ad will be automatically reviewed again. Check the ad’s status in the “Ads & assets” page for updates. Learn more about how to Fix an ad with policy violations. Appeal policy decision If you believe there’s been an error and that you haven’t violated Google Ads' policies, appeal the policy decision directly from your Google Ads account to request a review. If the review determines that your ads are compliant, they can run again. If you aren't able to fix these violations or choose not to, remove your ad to help prevent your account from becoming suspended in the future for repeated policy violations.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. In light of the Chrome Plugin Power Saver feature launch in September 2015, your creatives should be built using HTML5 rather than Flash to prevent your Flash ads from being automatically paused, which negatively impacts performance and reach. Google Ads will not allow the upload of Flash creatives starting in June 2016; any Flash creatives uploaded prior to June will stop serving in January 2017. Third-party ad serving is only available to a limited number of customers on a case-by-case basis. Except where indicated otherwise in this policy, all creatives associated with a third-party tag must comply with Google's image ad policies. You must comply with these policies if you serve ads or use pixel-tracking (beacons) on the Google Display Network and: You are participating in the third-party ad serving program. You use a third-party server. You use a research vendor. You are a third-party server. You are a research vendor. If you have a Google Account Manager: Submit a request for third-party implementation for your Google Ads account with the Third-party tags and pixels implementation request form. If you don't have a Google Account Manager: To request implementation of third-party 1x1 pixel and 3P viewability tags, submit the Third-party tags and pixels implementation request form. To request implementation of third-party ad tags, submit the Third-party ad tag implementation request for unmanaged accounts form. Note: You can implement third-party tracking for a Performance Max campaign that is managed through Search Ads 360. Currently, tracking is only limited to display creatives within your Performance Max campaigns, and not video related information.

For an optimum viewer experience, we recommend compressing and using the minimum required assets for the initial load. Total non-viewer initiated load size: 2.2 MB maximum. This includes initial and subsequent/polite loads. Viewer-initiated load size Up to 10 MB per interaction. 2.2 MB maximum total load size is recommended for optimal performance. For an optimum viewer experience, third-party served ads must not exceed 40% of the central processing unit (CPU) capacity of a viewer’s computer. Common causes of high CPU use are continued animation, heavy animation sequences, and animation that surpasses the 30-second limit. If applicable, you can use the Task Manager feature in Windows to check for compliance with this rule. Animation length Maximum host-initiated play: 30 seconds Maximum user-initiated play (click required): 4 minutes Creatives Creatives may not expand past ad unit boundaries. All creatives must be free of applications including, but not limited to, ActiveX, viruses, exit pops, spyware, and malware. Creative coding must not use cross-domain scripting or set cookies in unapproved domains. All creatives must open in new windows. The target window for the click-through URL must be set to \"_blank\" so the click-through will open in a new window. Do not leave the target statement undeclared. All sound and animation (including video) must stop immediately upon an exit click. For ads with partially black, white, or transparent backgrounds, you must add a visible border of a contrasting color to the majority background color of the creative (for example, not black for partially black backgrounds, and not white for partially white backgrounds). You must provide a default image. HTML5 creatives File requirements Flash content and Flash fallback (SWFs and FLVs) are not allowed to serve with an HTML5 ad. HTML5 ads must include: <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and must contain a <html>, <head> and <body>tag. Ad dimensions must match the placement dimensions to prevent distortions. Add an ad size <meta> tag within the <head> tag. If your HTML5 ad includes video content, you must provide video assets in an MP4 format as well as either WebM or Ogg formats to ensure compatibility across all major browsers. Rich media and other features Features including the following, must be fully tested and pre-approved for cross-device functionality by gTech. Any ad element not meeting the specifications in this policy will be returned for revision, which may cause a campaign delay. Expandable ad units In-banner video Research, including in-banner surveys or invitations Geolocation Forms Drag and drop or mouseover/hover interaction 3D transforms Mobile in-app ads Creatives Standard format image tags, iFrame and Javascript tags are eligible to run on the AdMob In-App Network. Note that the third party ad server determines which creative to serve. If a tag contains an unsupported file type (such as SWF), the ad server will serve the backup/default creative. Similarly, advertisers should be aware that if their third party served creatives contain other features, such as cookies, they may not be as effective in the mobile app environment. The only inventory available for mobile in-app expandables are interstitials, which are not available for third party ad serving at this time. SSL-compliant ad units SSL-compliant ad units are accepted on the Google Display Network according to the following policies. We require that all ads and tracking pixels targeting SSL inventory are SSL-compliant. As SSL inventory increases on the web, non SSL-compliant ads will have fewer opportunities to serve and will win fewer auctions. To maximize your ads' eligibility for the available inventory, they should adhere to the SSL-compliant ad guidelines below. SSL-compliant ads guidelines Notify your Google account representative when submitting an SSL-compliant ad. Note that if an ad is marked as SSL- compliant but generates any non-SSL-compliant responses, the ad will be disapproved. For secure pages (HTTPS://) the ad, creative and tracking pixels must only use HTTPS. Additionally, for ads and creatives loaded using a secure connection (HTTPS://), all subsequent requests to media assets or tracking URLs must also use a secure connection (HTTPS://). This ensures that all creatives can be delivered over HTTP and HTTPS without the need for special trafficking. If tracking pixel URLs are provided, they must be SSL compliant (begin with HTTPS://). The only exception is the click URL (target landing page), which may be non-SSL compliant. Any 4th-party calls to other technologies within the ad unit must also be from SSL-compliant vendors. Approved SSL-compliant ad vendors are listed in the Vendors lists. Third-party tracking You must comply with these policies if you use third-party tracking, including pixels (beacons) on the Google Display Network. The policies under “SSL-compliant ad units” also apply. Format Only 1x1 pixels are supported for third-party tracking site-served ad units. Javascript is not allowed. Click trackers are supported for third-party tracking clicks on select site-served ad units. See the Ad formats section for a full list. Certified vendors Google Ads supports third-party tracking on the Google Display Network from certified vendors. Please consult the list of certified vendors for your region in the Vendor list section. Buyers may only use a technology vendor approved by Google, which must be declared per Google instructions. Click tracking vendors are not required to be certified for third-party ad serving. Fourth-party calls and multiple vendor tracking Multiple impression pixels per event are not supported for our site-served display ad units through Google Ads. However, clients may submit up to 3 pixels per event (i.e., 3 impression, 3 view, and 3 skip) for site-served video ad units. For any additional pixels, clients may daisy-chain multiple vendor tracking or fourth-party calls into a single asset. This must be a standard format 1x1 pixel that fires simultaneous calls to each vendor upon serving the impression. The client or agency is responsible for piggybacking or daisy-chaining the pixels. The number amount of fourth-party calls permitted within a third party tag varies by the type of vendor that is being used (1 certified ad server or Rich Media vendor, 3 research products and 1 Online Behavioral Advertising Option Icon). Ad formats Third-party pixels are supported on the below ad formats. Some ad formats allow for multiple events to be tracked. However, only one pixel can be appended to site-served display units, while up to 3 pixels can be appended per event to site-served video ad units. Ad format Pixels allowed Click trackers allowed Display (including Ready Lightbox) ads Yes - 1 impression pixel Yes GDN Responsive ads Yes - 1 impression pixel Yes TrueView in-stream ads skippable Yes - up to 3 impression, 3 view, and 3 skip pixels Yes TrueView in-stream ads non-skippable Yes - 3 impression pixel Yes Bumper ads Yes - 3 impression pixel Yes Outstream ads Yes - 3 impression pixel Yes In-feed video ads No No Text ads No Yes Gmail ads No Yes Performance Max responsive ads Yes - 1 impression pixel No Companion banners Separate tracking for companion banners is not supported for auction video ads. Videos and their accompanying companion banners will share the same tracking assets. Policy Requirements on the Google Display Network through Google Ads General guidelines and editorial policies Google reserves the right to remove any ads deemed intrusive or inappropriate. Please review our advertising policies for more information. Ads must: Conform to Google's specifications. Contain family safe content. Ads must not: Contain fake hyperlinks. Resemble Windows, Unix, or Mac dialog boxes. Simulate fake interactivity. Contain sexual content. Contain audio (exception: user-initiated rich media ads). Initiate downloads. Be intrusive. Advertise competitive content. Contain misleading content. Third-party ad serving Cookies and targeting: You may use cookies for reporting purposes and creative selection, provided that the data you use was collected in accordance with industry standards: In cases where the NAI and IAB UK policies conflict, the more stringent policy will apply. Google reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to determine your compliance with these standards. In particular, the certification process requires you to have the following: A descriptive privacy policy on your site A prominent link to opt-out from the privacy policy No PII used in the creation of segments (including PII related to the user's mobile phone device) No sensitive segments or segments targeted at children under 13 years of age No packet sniffing in the collection of behavioral data NAI Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.networkadvertising.org) IAB UK Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.youronlinechoices.com) Data collection: You may use cookies, web beacons, or other tracking mechanisms to collect pseudonymous traffic data for aggregated reach, frequency and/or conversion reporting, provided a certified third-party vendor is used for this purpose. Collecting impression-level data through cookies or other mechanisms for purposes of re-targeting, interest-based categorization, or syndication to third parties on Google Display Network inventory is strictly prohibited. (This restriction does not apply to view-level, click-level, or conversion-level data.) You may not link cookies, web beacons, or other tracking mechanisms to personally identifiable information (PII) or precise user location for behavioral targeting unless the user has knowingly and explicitly opted in. (For purposes of this policy, PII and precise user location do not include IP addresses.) You must not, and must not assist or knowingly permit any third party to set, modify or delete cookies on any Google-owned and operated domains, including but not limited to Search Ads 360 domains. You are required to maintain a clear and prominent privacy policy that fully discloses any data collection, sharing, and usage related to your use of Google products., This includes detailing the technologies used, such as cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, or other identifiers. This applies for data collection, sharing and usage on any platform, surface or property ( such as web, app, Connected TV, gaming console or email publication). Fourth-party calls: Ads may include tracking elements from certified third-party servers or research vendors already approved by Google. No fourth-party calls are permitted, except in the following cases: Tracking elements from certified third-party servers or research vendors explicitly authorized by Google Calls to Google hosted and approved code libraries jQueries to Google and Amazon storage jQueries solely for the purpose of creative rendering. Only the AJAX post() method is allowed; the AJAX get() method is not allowed. For more information, refer to the Guidance for complying with the Identifying Users Policy. Each tag must be associated with a single advertiser. Multiple advertisers cannot be represented through a single tag. The maximum amount of fourth-party calls permitted within a third party tag varies by the type of vendor(s) being used and is limited to: One certified ad server or Rich Media vendor Up to 3 research products One Online Behavioral Advertising Option Icon. Creative approval: All creatives and tags that call the third-party server or research vendor must be fully tested and pre-approved by Google Ad Operations at least 72 hours prior to the campaign start date. Creative modifications: Creative substitution or modification through a third-party vendor without prior approval isn't allowed. All creatives must be pre-approved by Google Ad Operations. Creatives with dynamically changing content must undergo initial review and be pre-approved by Google Ad Operations but may be exempt from additional reviews and approvals at Google's sole discretion. Delays due to revisions: Any ad elements that do not comply with these specifications in this policy will be returned for revision, which may cause a campaign delay. Tag performance: Tags must render consistently and meet Google's performance or reliability standards. Campaigns may be paused or stopped if tags do not comply. Sending tags: All tags must be sent in an email text attachment, not in the body of an email. Reporting: Traffic or impression reports provided by Google will serve as the official record between Google and the advertising partner. Any reports delivered to the advertising partner by the third party will not affect the rights or obligations of Google and the advertising partner. Data from context-aware macros: Unless explicitly permitted by Google in writing, you may only use data from context- aware macros exclusively for the impression associated with that data. You may not use data from context-aware macros elsewhere or at any other time. Site-level tagging: When using Google's placement targeting feature, you must aggregate a minimum of four unique web properties with adequate impression distribution across properties with each ad tag. You may not associate impression-level cookies, web beacons, or other tracking mechanisms with individual sites. Brand Features and Publicity: You may not publicly indicate your participation or compatibility with the program or disclose your relationship with Google without prior written approval from Google. Google Analytics auto-tagging: Google Analytics' auto-tagging feature is not currently compatible with third-party served ads. If you rely on auto-tagging, consider maintaining separate accounts for third-party served ads and Google Ads-hosted ads. Follow these instructions to enable or disable auto-tagging. Policies: When creating ads, cross-domain scripting and setting cookies on unapproved domains are not permitted. Ads must support Google's click-tracking. Where supported, all click events must be passed to Google. HTTP headers for Google's click-tracking URL must be sent by the viewer's browser. A client-side HTTP request, not a server-side request, must be sent to the Google click-tracking URL. Pop-up windows A pop-up: Is a window that opens in addition to the original window. Includes pop-unders, timed or intermittent pop-ups, mock system warnings, and pages that automatically initiate a download. Is prohibited regardless of its content. Audio effects Audio requirements: Effects must be user-initiated on click; ads may not play sound automatically. Audio settings must be set to 'off' by default. Users must have the option to mute all audio in the ad. Audio volume must be encoded at no more than -12 db. Personally-identifiable information Ads may not directly capture any personally-identifiable user information. Personal information includes, but isn't limited to, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and credit card numbers. No sensitive information can be collected through the ad. You may not associate cookies, web beacons, or other tracking mechanisms with personally-identifiable information (PII) for any purpose or with precise user location for behavior targeting unless the user has knowingly and expressly opted in. (For purposes of this document, PII and precise user location does not include IP addresses.) Research If authorized by Google, you may implement research studies in connection with an ad campaign. If expressly approved by Google, these research studies may be exempt from some of the third-party serving restrictions outlined above. All research must be conducted as follows: You may conduct research only for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of mutually agreed-upon, ad-served advertising placements purchased through Google. Google must approve, in writing, the public disclosure of any campaign-specific data and compilation or aggregation of data across multiple campaigns attributable to Google prior to any such disclosure. Only a third-party research provider that appears on Google's approved provider list may conduct research. A maximum of 3 research products (Analytics/Performance, Brand-Lift Studies, Verification Services, etc) are allowed within an ad tag. Even if a Google-paid study is conducted, this should be included in the 3-product maximum. All methodologies and survey tools (including recruitment processes, incentives, solicitation/invitation content, questionnaire content, data collection, and survey appearance) will be subject to Google's advance approval. For brand studies, please reference the following survey content guidelines. You are responsible for ensuring that all survey results and associated data are kept strictly confidential, and that personally- identifiable data is not solicited or collected, except as necessary by you for granting incentives to research participants. All personally-identifiable data may be used only to deliver the relevant incentives, and such data must be destroyed promptly following delivery of the relevant incentives. If you are a verification or audience metric service provider, as classified by Google, you must be able to demonstrate that your service has gone through a formal third-party audit. Any data you collect must be used strictly for reporting against the advertiser's campaign. You must not collect site-level information (domain/URL) in connection with a cookie. You may not sell or make available for resale any information you may collect via your service to others. You may not share or aggregate data beyond the advertiser's campaign for whom you are providing the reporting. Note: Verification Services are not permitted to drop cookies. Verification and audience metric service providers may only be used for research and analytics purposes. You may not use any technology that will effect or prevent the serving of the ad, which includes but is not limited to services like ad blocking. Certification of these vendors only indicates that Google permits their use by clients on our network, but Google does not validate the accuracy of the data and analysis reported by any research vendors in our program including but not limited to verification and audience metric service providers. Google does not offer credits for any discrepancies between our reports and the third party's reports or for any issues flagged by these types of services. Online Behavioral Advertising Option Icon If you would like to display a third-party Advertising Option Icon for online behaviorally targeted ads, you must abide by the following requirements: For ads served on the Google Display Network for most publishers, Google's Advertising Option Icon (“AdChoices”) will appear at the top right corner of the ad unit in accordance to industry standards. If you choose to use a third-party Advertising Option Icon and layer it over the Google Advertising Option Icon, the third-party vendor is responsible for complying to the requirements outlined by the Self- Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.aboutads.info), which includes but is not limited to the following specifications: The layer must use the Advertising Option Icon’s official 76x15 “AdChoices” image. If the 19x15 “i” image is used instead, the layer should change to the full 76x15 “AdChoices” image upon mouseover. The Icon must appear in the top-right corner of the ad. The ad must have a z-index value of less than 9010 to ensure that the Google and third-party icon appear above the ad. If you are using an expandable ad unit, the initial unexpanded layer of the creative must still have a z-index value that is less than 9010, and the expanded layer must have a z-index value greater than 1110. Additionally, if a third-party Advertising Option Icon covers the Google Advertising Option Icon, the 3rd-party icon must include the Google, Inc. as a company associated with user data collection and/or usage within the ad, and the user must be provided with Google’s cookie opt-out. Any privacy notification must appear within the ad units boundaries or open in a new browser window. No pop-ups are allowed. Any vendors that are permitted by Google to display an Advertising Option Icon may not write and/or read cookies in association with any functionality of the icon. You may only serve third-party Advertising Option Icons from a Google-approved vendor. See the list of approved Google Ads third-party vendors and search for vendors that include \"Advertising option icon\" in the \"Product offerings\" column. Vendors list (Global) Google Ads third-party vendors list Requirements on the Google Display Network through the Google Ad Manager To run ads on the Google Display Network through the Google Ad Manager, you must follow the requirements below. Third-party ad serving Cookies and targeting: You may use cookies for reporting purposes and to target ads, provided that the data you use was collected in accordance with industry standards: NAI Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.networkadvertising.org) IAB UK Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.youronlinechoices.com) Where there is a conflict between the NAI and IAB UK policies, the more stringent policy applies. Google determines at its own discretion whether or not you are compliant with these standards. In particular, the certification process requires you to have the following: A descriptive privacy policy on your site A prominent link to opt-out from the privacy policy No PII used in the creation of segments (including PII related to the user's mobile phone device) No sensitive segments or segments targeted at children under 13 years of age No packet sniffing in the collection of behavioral data Data collection: You may use a cookie, web beacon, or other tracking mechanism to collect pseudonymous traffic data for purposes of aggregated reach, frequency and/or conversion reporting, provided you use a certified third party vendor for this purpose. Collecting impression-level data via cookies or other mechanisms for purposes of subsequent re-targeting, interest category categorization, or syndication to other parties on Google Display Network inventory is prohibited. (This restriction does not apply to click- or conversion-level data.) You may not associate cookies, web beacons, or other tracking mechanisms with personally- identifiable information (PII) for any purpose or with precise user location for behavior targeting unless the user has knowingly and expressly opted in. (For purposes of this document, PII and precise user location does not include IP addresses.) You will not, and will not assist or knowingly permit any third party, to set a cookie, or alter or delete a cookie set, on any Google owned and operated domains, including, without limitation, on a Search Ads 360 domain. You must display a prominent privacy policy and disclose clearly any data collection, sharing and usage that takes place in connection with your use of Google products, including information about the technologies used, such as your use of cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, or other identifiers. This applies for data collection, sharing and usage on any platform, surface or property (e.g., web, app, Connected TV, gaming console or email publication). Note that 3rd-party reported reach and frequency numbers tend to be less accurate on the mobile platform. Fourth-party calls: All ads may only include tracking elements from certified third-party servers or research vendors already approved by Google. No fourth-party calls are permitted, except tracking elements associated with certified third-party servers or research vendors expressly authorized by Google. Tag performance: Tags must display consistently. If a tag doesn't conform to our performance or reliability standards, we reserve the right to pause or stop the campaign. Reporting: Traffic or impression reports provided by Google will be the reports of record between Google and the advertising partner. Any reports delivered to the advertising partner by the third party will not affect the rights or obligations of Google and the advertising partner. Technical specifications and creatives Ad Exchange buyers of ad inventory displayed on websites must follow the same policies detailed in the Google Ads section, Technical specifications and creatives. Ad Exchange buyers of ad inventory displayed in mobile applications (\"In-App Ads\") must follow the technical specifications and creatives immediately below: Technical specifications for in-app ads Device type (Android or iOS only) Unit sizes Tag types File types Static image max file size Smartphone 320x50 300x250 336x280 Interstitial HTML Image tag wrapped in anchor tag JPEG PNG GIF 150KB initial download 5MB total size JavaScript tag MRAID HTML5 Tablet 300x250 728x90 468x60 336x280 Interstitial HTML Image tag wrapped in anchor tag JPEG PNG GIF 150KB initial download 5MB total size JavaScript tag MRAID HTML5 In-app ad creatives In-app ads served by third parties must comply with both Google's image ad policies and the following policies. Only standard image ad formats (JPEG, PNG, and GIF) may be third-party served. Third-party served ads must not contain Flash or JavaScript. Standard image banner ads must be served via a standard redirect tag, as in: <a href=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" /></a> SSL-compliant ad units SSL-compliant ad units are accepted on the Google Display Network according to the following policies: SSL-compliant ads guidelines All ad responses must be SSL-compliant (“HTTPS”). All servers involved require full SSL certification. It is preferred that your ad tag can auto-detect that it is being requested from the HTTP/HTTPS protocol and will auto-adjust any responses to be SSL-compliant if necessary. Otherwise, Google has a protocol macro that we can insert in any URIs or ad tags to auto-update “http” to “https” if necessary. Any 4th-party calls to other technologies within the ad unit must also be from SSL-compliant vendors that have been certified by Google. Ad Exchange buyers must declare through RTB or the Ad Exchange UI that the ad is SSL-compliant. Note that if an ad is declared as SSL-compliant but makes any non-SSL-compliant responses, the ad will be disapproved. Please see the section In-stream video ad units (VAST-compliant) for SSL-compliant VAST ad specifications. A vendor must receive specific certification to serve ads on SSL-compliant publisher inventory. Approved SSL-compliant ad vendors are listed in the Vendors lists. Expandable ad units Expandable ad units are accepted on the Google Display Network according to the following policies: Creative specifications User-initiated click-to-expand and rollover-to-expand Close: on-click or mouse-off Maximum file size: 150K initial, 2.2MB polite Panels must contain a prominent \"Close X\" (in 16 pt. font or larger) in the corner of the unit Approved vendors Studio EyeWonder Flashtalking MediaMind PointRoll Unicast Mediaplex Weborama Adform Flite Kpsule Linkstorm Maximum expanded dimensions Interactive Advertising Bureau size Expanded size 468 x 60 468 x 210 728 x 90 728 x 300 300 x 250 600 x 300 160 x 600 400 x 600 120 x 600 420 x 600 In-stream video ad units (VAST-compliant) Third-party in-stream video ads are accepted on Ad Exchange according to the following policies: Technical specifications In-stream video ad File types Maximum file size Video length Maximum frame rate Unit sizes Video Audio Maximum Recommended 480x360 (4:3) 640x360 (16:9) 1920x800 (5:2) H.264 (video/mp4 only) and WebM (video/webm only) video file types must all be included (other formats may be included but may not be used) MP3 or AAC preferred 10 MB 60 seconds <15 seconds (to be eligible for the most publisher inventory, including YouTube) 30fps Companion ad (optional, but recommended) File types Maximum file size Animation length Maximum frame rate Unit sizes Image Flash Host-initiated play User-initiated play (rollover or click) 300x250 Static GIF, JPG, or PNG SWF with backup GIF/JPG (Flash 7 through 11.2; AS2 & AS3) 50K 30 seconds 4 minutes 24 FPS 300x60 Creatives Third-party, in-stream ads must be served via a linear VAST tag (pre-fetch tag) by a VAST vendor approved specifically for Ad Exchange. The VAST tag must comply with Google's XML summary for VAST ad server response. For each video ad served in the VAST tag, there needs to be a minimum of 2 separate nodes included - one for MP4 and WebM video formats. Other formats may be included, but will not be used. Consistent <AdSystem> Node Value: Please be sure that your all of your VAST tags include a specific consistent value for your company in the <AdSystem> node in the VAST XML. For example, Google would always include the following for all our VAST tags: <AdSystem>Google</AdSystem> Unique Ad ID Value: Each VAST tag generated should include a unique value for the “id” attribute in the node. Two different VAST tags should not have the same Ad id value. For instance: - VAST tag 1: <Ad id=\"3947179\"> - VAST tag 2: <Ad id=\"8741831\"> Note that only the following resource types will be allowed for node in the VAST XML: StaticResource: URI to a static file, such as an image or SWF file IFrameResource: URI source for an IFrame to display the companion element The HTMLResource type will no longer be permitted. For Google’s Flash SDK to serve video ads from a 3rd-party ad server, the 3rd-party ad server must include a crossdomain.xml with specifications to allow access to all specific Google domains or all domains. Also, the attribute secure needs to be set to “false”. The crossdomain.xml should be formatted as follows: <cross-domain-policy> <!-- Allow access to ALL domains <allow-access-from domain=\"*\" secure=\"false\"/> <!-- OR allow access to the domain from originating request </cross-domain-policy> Important: When you add a domain to your website's crossdomain.xml file, any Flash file hosted within that domain can access data belonging to users logged into your website. Due to this, you should generally not add advertising network hosts to crossdomain.xml files on websites that contain authenticated functionality such as user profiles. For Google’s HTML5 SDK to serve video ads from a third-party ad server, the third-party ad server must include a CORS header in all of its responses. The CORS header must be formatted as follows: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [allow access to the domain from originating request] OR Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Note: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * cannot be use in combination with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Audio is not allowed for companion ads. Creatives may not expand past ad unit boundaries. On all ads with partially black, white, or transparent backgrounds, you must add a visible border of a contrasting color to the majority background color of the creative. All creatives must be free of applications including, but not limited to, ActiveX, viruses, exit pops, spyware, and malware. Companion ads containing Flash must not exceed 50% of a user's CPU. Common causes of high CPU use are continued animation, heavy animation sequences, and animation that surpasses the 30-second limit. If applicable, you can use the Task Manager feature in Windows to check for compliance with this rule. Creative coding may not use cross-domain scripting or set cookies in unapproved domains. All creatives must open in new windows. The target window for the click-through URL must be set to \"_blank\" so the click-through will open in a new window. Do not leave the target statement undeclared. For Flash creatives: Creatives must be built to use Flash versions 7 through 11.2 (AS2 & AS3). You must supply a default image. If the browser doesn't support the Flash version used for your creative, the default image will be served. The last frame of the animation must include the following code in actionscript: \"stop()\". You must include a clickTag layer. The clickTag layer must be the topmost layer. You may use a maximum of 2 clickTags in a single creative. Creatives must support Google's click tracking. Where supported, all click events must be passed to Google. For VAST wrappers: No more than 2 (two) VAST wrapper redirects to 1 (one) VAST In-Line is permitted. Supported TrackingEvents (wrapper may include more than one node per each event): start firstQuartile midpoint thirdQuartile complete mute unmute pause resume For SSL-compliant VAST ads: A vendor must receive separate certification to serve VAST ads on SSL-compliant publisher inventory. All ad responses must be SSL-compliant (“HTTPS”). All servers involved require full SSL certification. It is preferred that your VAST tag can auto-detect that it is being requested from the HTTP/HTTPS protocol and will auto-adjust the URIs and companion banners to be SSL-compliant if necessary. Otherwise, Google has a protocol macro that we can insert in your VAST tag to auto-update “http” to “https” if necessary. The vendor/Ad Exchange buyer must ensure that any URIs within the VAST XML (e.g. the , , and other nodes) that are served by a party other than the primary VAST vendor are also from vendors approved by Google for SSL-compliant ad serving/tracking. The companion ad banner as well as any 4th-party calls to other technologies within the companion ad banner must also be made from SSL-compliant vendors that have been certified by Google. Ad Exchange buyers must declare through RTB or the Ad Exchange UI that the ad is SSL-compliant. Note that if an ad is declared as SSL- compliant but makes any non-SSL-compliant responses, the ad will be disapproved. VPAID will be available on non-GDN Ad Exchange inventory and must follow the following policies: Live feeds or User-Generated Content are not accepted. Overlays and other non-linear formats are not currently accepted. All VPAID tags must conform to all current Ad Exchange VAST 2.0 and 3.0 policies. General guidelines and editorial policies Google Ad Manager buyers must follow the same policies detailed in the Google Ads section on General guidelines and editorial policies. Pop-up windows Google Ad Manager buyers must following the same policies detailed in the Google Ads section on Pop-up windows. Audio effects Google Ad Manager buyers must following the same policies detailed in the Google Ads section on Audio effects. Personally-identifiable information Google Ad Manager buyers must follow the same policies detailed in the Google Ads section on Personally-identifiable information. Research If authorized by Google, you may implement research studies in connection with an ad campaign. If expressly approved by Google, these research studies may be exempt from some of the third-party serving restrictions outlined above. Research tags may not be used in in-app ad campaigns. All research must be conducted as follows: You may conduct research only for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of mutually agreed-upon, ad-served advertising placements purchased through Google. You may only use a web beacon or other tracking mechanism in order to track a user's exposure to an ad. No surveys or survey invitations are allowed to be served on the Google Display Network via the Ad Exchange. When trafficking 3rd-party tags that serve surveys and survey invitations, the appropriate research vendor needs to be selected from the \"Ad Technology\" drop-down in the user interface. This will allow the survey and survey invitations to run on other AdX inventory, but not the Google Display Network. Google must approve, in writing, the public disclosure of any campaign-specific data and compilation or aggregation of data across multiple campaigns attributable to Google prior to any such disclosure. Only a third-party research provider that appears on Google's approved provider list may conduct research. You are responsible for ensuring that all survey results and associated data are kept strictly confidential, and that personally- identifiable data is not solicited or collected, except as necessary by you for granting incentives to research participants. All personally-identifiable data may be used only to deliver the relevant incentives, and such data must be destroyed promptly following delivery of the relevant incentives. If you are a verification or audience metric service provider, as classified by Google, you must be able to demonstrate that your service has gone through a formal third-party audit. Any data you collect must be used strictly for reporting against the advertiser's campaign. You must not collect site-level information (domain/URL) in connection with a cookie. You may not sell or make available for resale any information you may collect via your service to others. You may not share or aggregate data beyond the advertiser's campaign for whom you are providing the reporting. NOTE: Verification Services are not permitted to drop cookies. Verification and audience metric service providers may only be used for research and analytics purposes. You may not use any technology that will effect or prevent the serving of the ad, which includes but is not limited to services like ad blocking. Certification of these vendors only indicates that Google permits their use by clients on our network, but Google does not validate the accuracy of the data and analysis reported by any research vendors in our program including but not limited to verification and audience metric service providers. Google does not offer credits for any discrepancies between our reports and the third party's reports or for any issues flagged by these types of services. Online Behavioral Advertising Option Icon If you would like to display a third-party Advertising Option Icon for online behaviorally targeted ads, you must abide by the following requirements: If you choose to use a third-party Advertising Option Icon, the third-party vendor is responsible for complying to the requirements outlined by the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.aboutads.info), which includes but is not limited to the following specifications: The layer must use the Advertising Option Icon’s official 76x15 “AdChoices” image. If the 19x15 “i” image is used instead, the layer should change to the full 76x15 “AdChoices” image upon mouseover. The Icon must appear in the top-right corner of the ad. Any privacy notification must appear within the ad units boundaries or open in a new browser window. No pop-ups are allowed. Any vendors that are permitted by Google to display an Advertising Option Icon may not write and/or read cookies in association with any functionality of the icon. You may only serve third-party Advertising Option Icons from a Google-approved vendor. See the list of approved Ad Exchange vendors and search for vendors that include \"Advertising option icon\" in the \"Product offerings\" column.

        "content": "Requirements for third-party ad serving About Google third-party policies Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. In light of the Chrome Plugin Power Saver feature launch in September 2015, your creatives should be built using HTML5 rather than Flash to prevent your Flash ads from being automatically paused, which negatively impacts performance and reach. Google Ads will not allow the upload of Flash creatives starting in June 2016; any Flash creatives uploaded prior to June will stop serving in January 2017. Third-party ad serving is only available to a limited number of customers on a case-by-case basis. Except where indicated otherwise in this policy, all creatives associated with a third-party tag must comply with Google's image ad policies. You must comply with these policies if you serve ads or use pixel-tracking (beacons) on the Google Display Network and: You are participating in the third-party ad serving program. You use a third-party server. You use a research vendor. You are a third-party server. You are a research vendor. If you have a Google Account Manager: Submit a request for third-party implementation for your Google Ads account with the Third-party tags and pixels implementation request form. If you don't have a Google Account Manager: To request implementation of third-party 1x1 pixel and 3P viewability tags, submit the Third-party tags and pixels implementation request form. To request implementation of third-party ad tags, submit the Third-party ad tag implementation request for unmanaged accounts form. Note: You can implement third-party tracking for a Performance Max campaign that is managed through Search Ads 360. Currently, tracking is only limited to display creatives within your Performance Max campaigns, and not video related information.

For an optimum viewer experience, we recommend compressing and using the minimum required assets for the initial load. Total non-viewer initiated load size: 2.2 MB maximum. This includes initial and subsequent/polite loads. Viewer-initiated load size Up to 10 MB per interaction. 2.2 MB maximum total load size is recommended for optimal performance. For an optimum viewer experience, third-party served ads must not exceed 40% of the central processing unit (CPU) capacity of a viewer’s computer. Common causes of high CPU use are continued animation, heavy animation sequences, and animation that surpasses the 30-second limit. If applicable, you can use the Task Manager feature in Windows to check for compliance with this rule. Animation length Maximum host-initiated play: 30 seconds Maximum user-initiated play (click required): 4 minutes Creatives Creatives may not expand past ad unit boundaries. All creatives must be free of applications including, but not limited to, ActiveX, viruses, exit pops, spyware, and malware. Creative coding must not use cross-domain scripting or set cookies in unapproved domains. All creatives must open in new windows. The target window for the click-through URL must be set to \"_blank\" so the click-through will open in a new window. Do not leave the target statement undeclared. All sound and animation (including video) must stop immediately upon an exit click. For ads with partially black, white, or transparent backgrounds, you must add a visible border of a contrasting color to the majority background color of the creative (for example, not black for partially black backgrounds, and not white for partially white backgrounds). You must provide a default image. HTML5 creatives File requirements Flash content and Flash fallback (SWFs and FLVs) are not allowed to serve with an HTML5 ad. HTML5 ads must include: <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and must contain a <html>, <head> and <body>tag. Ad dimensions must match the placement dimensions to prevent distortions. Add an ad size <meta> tag within the <head> tag. If your HTML5 ad includes video content, you must provide video assets in an MP4 format as well as either WebM or Ogg formats to ensure compatibility across all major browsers. Rich media and other features Features including the following, must be fully tested and pre-approved for cross-device functionality by gTech. Any ad element not meeting the specifications in this policy will be returned for revision, which may cause a campaign delay. Expandable ad units In-banner video Research, including in-banner surveys or invitations Geolocation Forms Drag and drop or mouseover/hover interaction 3D transforms Mobile in-app ads Creatives Standard format image tags, iFrame and Javascript tags are eligible to run on the AdMob In-App Network. Note that the third party ad server determines which creative to serve. If a tag contains an unsupported file type (such as SWF), the ad server will serve the backup/default creative. Similarly, advertisers should be aware that if their third party served creatives contain other features, such as cookies, they may not be as effective in the mobile app environment. The only inventory available for mobile in-app expandables are interstitials, which are not available for third party ad serving at this time. SSL-compliant ad units SSL-compliant ad units are accepted on the Google Display Network according to the following policies. We require that all ads and tracking pixels targeting SSL inventory are SSL-compliant. As SSL inventory increases on the web, non SSL-compliant ads will have fewer opportunities to serve and will win fewer auctions. To maximize your ads' eligibility for the available inventory, they should adhere to the SSL-compliant ad guidelines below. SSL-compliant ads guidelines Notify your Google account representative when submitting an SSL-compliant ad. Note that if an ad is marked as SSL- compliant but generates any non-SSL-compliant responses, the ad will be disapproved. For secure pages (HTTPS://) the ad, creative and tracking pixels must only use HTTPS. Additionally, for ads and creatives loaded using a secure connection (HTTPS://), all subsequent requests to media assets or tracking URLs must also use a secure connection (HTTPS://). This ensures that all creatives can be delivered over HTTP and HTTPS without the need for special trafficking. If tracking pixel URLs are provided, they must be SSL compliant (begin with HTTPS://). The only exception is the click URL (target landing page), which may be non-SSL compliant. Any 4th-party calls to other technologies within the ad unit must also be from SSL-compliant vendors. Approved SSL-compliant ad vendors are listed in the Vendors lists. Third-party tracking You must comply with these policies if you use third-party tracking, including pixels (beacons) on the Google Display Network. The policies under “SSL-compliant ad units” also apply. Format Only 1x1 pixels are supported for third-party tracking site-served ad units. Javascript is not allowed. Click trackers are supported for third-party tracking clicks on select site-served ad units. See the Ad formats section for a full list. Certified vendors Google Ads supports third-party tracking on the Google Display Network from certified vendors. Please consult the list of certified vendors for your region in the Vendor list section. Buyers may only use a technology vendor approved by Google, which must be declared per Google instructions. Click tracking vendors are not required to be certified for third-party ad serving. Fourth-party calls and multiple vendor tracking Multiple impression pixels per event are not supported for our site-served display ad units through Google Ads. However, clients may submit up to 3 pixels per event (i.e., 3 impression, 3 view, and 3 skip) for site-served video ad units. For any additional pixels, clients may daisy-chain multiple vendor tracking or fourth-party calls into a single asset. This must be a standard format 1x1 pixel that fires simultaneous calls to each vendor upon serving the impression. The client or agency is responsible for piggybacking or daisy-chaining the pixels. The number amount of fourth-party calls permitted within a third party tag varies by the type of vendor that is being used (1 certified ad server or Rich Media vendor, 3 research products and 1 Online Behavioral Advertising Option Icon). Ad formats Third-party pixels are supported on the below ad formats. Some ad formats allow for multiple events to be tracked. However, only one pixel can be appended to site-served display units, while up to 3 pixels can be appended per event to site-served video ad units. Ad format Pixels allowed Click trackers allowed Display (including Ready Lightbox) ads Yes - 1 impression pixel Yes GDN Responsive ads Yes - 1 impression pixel Yes TrueView in-stream ads skippable Yes - up to 3 impression, 3 view, and 3 skip pixels Yes TrueView in-stream ads non-skippable Yes - 3 impression pixel Yes Bumper ads Yes - 3 impression pixel Yes Outstream ads Yes - 3 impression pixel Yes In-feed video ads No No Text ads No Yes Gmail ads No Yes Performance Max responsive ads Yes - 1 impression pixel No Companion banners Separate tracking for companion banners is not supported for auction video ads. Videos and their accompanying companion banners will share the same tracking assets. Policy Requirements on the Google Display Network through Google Ads General guidelines and editorial policies Google reserves the right to remove any ads deemed intrusive or inappropriate. Please review our advertising policies for more information. Ads must: Conform to Google's specifications. Contain family safe content. Ads must not: Contain fake hyperlinks. Resemble Windows, Unix, or Mac dialog boxes. Simulate fake interactivity. Contain sexual content. Contain audio (exception: user-initiated rich media ads). Initiate downloads. Be intrusive. Advertise competitive content. Contain misleading content. Third-party ad serving Cookies and targeting: You may use cookies for reporting purposes and creative selection, provided that the data you use was collected in accordance with industry standards: In cases where the NAI and IAB UK policies conflict, the more stringent policy will apply. Google reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to determine your compliance with these standards. In particular, the certification process requires you to have the following: A descriptive privacy policy on your site A prominent link to opt-out from the privacy policy No PII used in the creation of segments (including PII related to the user's mobile phone device) No sensitive segments or segments targeted at children under 13 years of age No packet sniffing in the collection of behavioral data NAI Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.networkadvertising.org) IAB UK Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.youronlinechoices.com) Data collection: You may use cookies, web beacons, or other tracking mechanisms to collect pseudonymous traffic data for aggregated reach, frequency and/or conversion reporting, provided a certified third-party vendor is used for this purpose. Collecting impression-level data through cookies or other mechanisms for purposes of re-targeting, interest-based categorization, or syndication to third parties on Google Display Network inventory is strictly prohibited. (This restriction does not apply to view-level, click-level, or conversion-level data.) You may not link cookies, web beacons, or other tracking mechanisms to personally identifiable information (PII) or precise user location for behavioral targeting unless the user has knowingly and explicitly opted in. (For purposes of this policy, PII and precise user location do not include IP addresses.) You must not, and must not assist or knowingly permit any third party to set, modify or delete cookies on any Google-owned and operated domains, including but not limited to Search Ads 360 domains. You are required to maintain a clear and prominent privacy policy that fully discloses any data collection, sharing, and usage related to your use of Google products., This includes detailing the technologies used, such as cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, or other identifiers. This applies for data collection, sharing and usage on any platform, surface or property ( such as web, app, Connected TV, gaming console or email publication). Fourth-party calls: Ads may include tracking elements from certified third-party servers or research vendors already approved by Google. No fourth-party calls are permitted, except in the following cases: Tracking elements from certified third-party servers or research vendors explicitly authorized by Google Calls to Google hosted and approved code libraries jQueries to Google and Amazon storage jQueries solely for the purpose of creative rendering. Only the AJAX post() method is allowed; the AJAX get() method is not allowed. For more information, refer to the Guidance for complying with the Identifying Users Policy. Each tag must be associated with a single advertiser. Multiple advertisers cannot be represented through a single tag. The maximum amount of fourth-party calls permitted within a third party tag varies by the type of vendor(s) being used and is limited to: One certified ad server or Rich Media vendor Up to 3 research products One Online Behavioral Advertising Option Icon. Creative approval: All creatives and tags that call the third-party server or research vendor must be fully tested and pre-approved by Google Ad Operations at least 72 hours prior to the campaign start date. Creative modifications: Creative substitution or modification through a third-party vendor without prior approval isn't allowed. All creatives must be pre-approved by Google Ad Operations. Creatives with dynamically changing content must undergo initial review and be pre-approved by Google Ad Operations but may be exempt from additional reviews and approvals at Google's sole discretion. Delays due to revisions: Any ad elements that do not comply with these specifications in this policy will be returned for revision, which may cause a campaign delay. Tag performance: Tags must render consistently and meet Google's performance or reliability standards. Campaigns may be paused or stopped if tags do not comply. Sending tags: All tags must be sent in an email text attachment, not in the body of an email. Reporting: Traffic or impression reports provided by Google will serve as the official record between Google and the advertising partner. Any reports delivered to the advertising partner by the third party will not affect the rights or obligations of Google and the advertising partner. Data from context-aware macros: Unless explicitly permitted by Google in writing, you may only use data from context- aware macros exclusively for the impression associated with that data. You may not use data from context-aware macros elsewhere or at any other time. Site-level tagging: When using Google's placement targeting feature, you must aggregate a minimum of four unique web properties with adequate impression distribution across properties with each ad tag. You may not associate impression-level cookies, web beacons, or other tracking mechanisms with individual sites. Brand Features and Publicity: You may not publicly indicate your participation or compatibility with the program or disclose your relationship with Google without prior written approval from Google. Google Analytics auto-tagging: Google Analytics' auto-tagging feature is not currently compatible with third-party served ads. If you rely on auto-tagging, consider maintaining separate accounts for third-party served ads and Google Ads-hosted ads. Follow these instructions to enable or disable auto-tagging. Policies: When creating ads, cross-domain scripting and setting cookies on unapproved domains are not permitted. Ads must support Google's click-tracking. Where supported, all click events must be passed to Google. HTTP headers for Google's click-tracking URL must be sent by the viewer's browser. A client-side HTTP request, not a server-side request, must be sent to the Google click-tracking URL. Pop-up windows A pop-up: Is a window that opens in addition to the original window. Includes pop-unders, timed or intermittent pop-ups, mock system warnings, and pages that automatically initiate a download. Is prohibited regardless of its content. Audio effects Audio requirements: Effects must be user-initiated on click; ads may not play sound automatically. Audio settings must be set to 'off' by default. Users must have the option to mute all audio in the ad. Audio volume must be encoded at no more than -12 db. Personally-identifiable information Ads may not directly capture any personally-identifiable user information. Personal information includes, but isn't limited to, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, and credit card numbers. No sensitive information can be collected through the ad. You may not associate cookies, web beacons, or other tracking mechanisms with personally-identifiable information (PII) for any purpose or with precise user location for behavior targeting unless the user has knowingly and expressly opted in. (For purposes of this document, PII and precise user location does not include IP addresses.) Research If authorized by Google, you may implement research studies in connection with an ad campaign. If expressly approved by Google, these research studies may be exempt from some of the third-party serving restrictions outlined above. All research must be conducted as follows: You may conduct research only for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of mutually agreed-upon, ad-served advertising placements purchased through Google. Google must approve, in writing, the public disclosure of any campaign-specific data and compilation or aggregation of data across multiple campaigns attributable to Google prior to any such disclosure. Only a third-party research provider that appears on Google's approved provider list may conduct research. A maximum of 3 research products (Analytics/Performance, Brand-Lift Studies, Verification Services, etc) are allowed within an ad tag. Even if a Google-paid study is conducted, this should be included in the 3-product maximum. All methodologies and survey tools (including recruitment processes, incentives, solicitation/invitation content, questionnaire content, data collection, and survey appearance) will be subject to Google's advance approval. For brand studies, please reference the following survey content guidelines. You are responsible for ensuring that all survey results and associated data are kept strictly confidential, and that personally- identifiable data is not solicited or collected, except as necessary by you for granting incentives to research participants. All personally-identifiable data may be used only to deliver the relevant incentives, and such data must be destroyed promptly following delivery of the relevant incentives. If you are a verification or audience metric service provider, as classified by Google, you must be able to demonstrate that your service has gone through a formal third-party audit. Any data you collect must be used strictly for reporting against the advertiser's campaign. You must not collect site-level information (domain/URL) in connection with a cookie. You may not sell or make available for resale any information you may collect via your service to others. You may not share or aggregate data beyond the advertiser's campaign for whom you are providing the reporting. Note: Verification Services are not permitted to drop cookies. Verification and audience metric service providers may only be used for research and analytics purposes. You may not use any technology that will effect or prevent the serving of the ad, which includes but is not limited to services like ad blocking. Certification of these vendors only indicates that Google permits their use by clients on our network, but Google does not validate the accuracy of the data and analysis reported by any research vendors in our program including but not limited to verification and audience metric service providers. Google does not offer credits for any discrepancies between our reports and the third party's reports or for any issues flagged by these types of services. Online Behavioral Advertising Option Icon If you would like to display a third-party Advertising Option Icon for online behaviorally targeted ads, you must abide by the following requirements: For ads served on the Google Display Network for most publishers, Google's Advertising Option Icon (“AdChoices”) will appear at the top right corner of the ad unit in accordance to industry standards. If you choose to use a third-party Advertising Option Icon and layer it over the Google Advertising Option Icon, the third-party vendor is responsible for complying to the requirements outlined by the Self- Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.aboutads.info), which includes but is not limited to the following specifications: The layer must use the Advertising Option Icon’s official 76x15 “AdChoices” image. If the 19x15 “i” image is used instead, the layer should change to the full 76x15 “AdChoices” image upon mouseover. The Icon must appear in the top-right corner of the ad. The ad must have a z-index value of less than 9010 to ensure that the Google and third-party icon appear above the ad. If you are using an expandable ad unit, the initial unexpanded layer of the creative must still have a z-index value that is less than 9010, and the expanded layer must have a z-index value greater than 1110. Additionally, if a third-party Advertising Option Icon covers the Google Advertising Option Icon, the 3rd-party icon must include the Google, Inc. as a company associated with user data collection and/or usage within the ad, and the user must be provided with Google’s cookie opt-out. Any privacy notification must appear within the ad units boundaries or open in a new browser window. No pop-ups are allowed. Any vendors that are permitted by Google to display an Advertising Option Icon may not write and/or read cookies in association with any functionality of the icon. You may only serve third-party Advertising Option Icons from a Google-approved vendor. See the list of approved Google Ads third-party vendors and search for vendors that include \"Advertising option icon\" in the \"Product offerings\" column. Vendors list (Global) Google Ads third-party vendors list Requirements on the Google Display Network through the Google Ad Manager To run ads on the Google Display Network through the Google Ad Manager, you must follow the requirements below. Third-party ad serving Cookies and targeting: You may use cookies for reporting purposes and to target ads, provided that the data you use was collected in accordance with industry standards: NAI Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.networkadvertising.org) IAB UK Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.youronlinechoices.com) Where there is a conflict between the NAI and IAB UK policies, the more stringent policy applies. Google determines at its own discretion whether or not you are compliant with these standards. In particular, the certification process requires you to have the following: A descriptive privacy policy on your site A prominent link to opt-out from the privacy policy No PII used in the creation of segments (including PII related to the user's mobile phone device) No sensitive segments or segments targeted at children under 13 years of age No packet sniffing in the collection of behavioral data Data collection: You may use a cookie, web beacon, or other tracking mechanism to collect pseudonymous traffic data for purposes of aggregated reach, frequency and/or conversion reporting, provided you use a certified third party vendor for this purpose. Collecting impression-level data via cookies or other mechanisms for purposes of subsequent re-targeting, interest category categorization, or syndication to other parties on Google Display Network inventory is prohibited. (This restriction does not apply to click- or conversion-level data.) You may not associate cookies, web beacons, or other tracking mechanisms with personally- identifiable information (PII) for any purpose or with precise user location for behavior targeting unless the user has knowingly and expressly opted in. (For purposes of this document, PII and precise user location does not include IP addresses.) You will not, and will not assist or knowingly permit any third party, to set a cookie, or alter or delete a cookie set, on any Google owned and operated domains, including, without limitation, on a Search Ads 360 domain. You must display a prominent privacy policy and disclose clearly any data collection, sharing and usage that takes place in connection with your use of Google products, including information about the technologies used, such as your use of cookies, web beacons, IP addresses, or other identifiers. This applies for data collection, sharing and usage on any platform, surface or property (e.g., web, app, Connected TV, gaming console or email publication). Note that 3rd-party reported reach and frequency numbers tend to be less accurate on the mobile platform. Fourth-party calls: All ads may only include tracking elements from certified third-party servers or research vendors already approved by Google. No fourth-party calls are permitted, except tracking elements associated with certified third-party servers or research vendors expressly authorized by Google. Tag performance: Tags must display consistently. If a tag doesn't conform to our performance or reliability standards, we reserve the right to pause or stop the campaign. Reporting: Traffic or impression reports provided by Google will be the reports of record between Google and the advertising partner. Any reports delivered to the advertising partner by the third party will not affect the rights or obligations of Google and the advertising partner. Technical specifications and creatives Ad Exchange buyers of ad inventory displayed on websites must follow the same policies detailed in the Google Ads section, Technical specifications and creatives. Ad Exchange buyers of ad inventory displayed in mobile applications (\"In-App Ads\") must follow the technical specifications and creatives immediately below: Technical specifications for in-app ads Device type (Android or iOS only) Unit sizes Tag types File types Static image max file size Smartphone 320x50 300x250 336x280 Interstitial HTML Image tag wrapped in anchor tag JPEG PNG GIF 150KB initial download 5MB total size JavaScript tag MRAID HTML5 Tablet 300x250 728x90 468x60 336x280 Interstitial HTML Image tag wrapped in anchor tag JPEG PNG GIF 150KB initial download 5MB total size JavaScript tag MRAID HTML5 In-app ad creatives In-app ads served by third parties must comply with both Google's image ad policies and the following policies. Only standard image ad formats (JPEG, PNG, and GIF) may be third-party served. Third-party served ads must not contain Flash or JavaScript. Standard image banner ads must be served via a standard redirect tag, as in: <a href=\"...\"><img src=\"...\" /></a> SSL-compliant ad units SSL-compliant ad units are accepted on the Google Display Network according to the following policies: SSL-compliant ads guidelines All ad responses must be SSL-compliant (“HTTPS”). All servers involved require full SSL certification. It is preferred that your ad tag can auto-detect that it is being requested from the HTTP/HTTPS protocol and will auto-adjust any responses to be SSL-compliant if necessary. Otherwise, Google has a protocol macro that we can insert in any URIs or ad tags to auto-update “http” to “https” if necessary. Any 4th-party calls to other technologies within the ad unit must also be from SSL-compliant vendors that have been certified by Google. Ad Exchange buyers must declare through RTB or the Ad Exchange UI that the ad is SSL-compliant. Note that if an ad is declared as SSL-compliant but makes any non-SSL-compliant responses, the ad will be disapproved. Please see the section In-stream video ad units (VAST-compliant) for SSL-compliant VAST ad specifications. A vendor must receive specific certification to serve ads on SSL-compliant publisher inventory. Approved SSL-compliant ad vendors are listed in the Vendors lists. Expandable ad units Expandable ad units are accepted on the Google Display Network according to the following policies: Creative specifications User-initiated click-to-expand and rollover-to-expand Close: on-click or mouse-off Maximum file size: 150K initial, 2.2MB polite Panels must contain a prominent \"Close X\" (in 16 pt. font or larger) in the corner of the unit Approved vendors Studio EyeWonder Flashtalking MediaMind PointRoll Unicast Mediaplex Weborama Adform Flite Kpsule Linkstorm Maximum expanded dimensions Interactive Advertising Bureau size Expanded size 468 x 60 468 x 210 728 x 90 728 x 300 300 x 250 600 x 300 160 x 600 400 x 600 120 x 600 420 x 600 In-stream video ad units (VAST-compliant) Third-party in-stream video ads are accepted on Ad Exchange according to the following policies: Technical specifications In-stream video ad File types Maximum file size Video length Maximum frame rate Unit sizes Video Audio Maximum Recommended 480x360 (4:3) 640x360 (16:9) 1920x800 (5:2) H.264 (video/mp4 only) and WebM (video/webm only) video file types must all be included (other formats may be included but may not be used) MP3 or AAC preferred 10 MB 60 seconds <15 seconds (to be eligible for the most publisher inventory, including YouTube) 30fps Companion ad (optional, but recommended) File types Maximum file size Animation length Maximum frame rate Unit sizes Image Flash Host-initiated play User-initiated play (rollover or click) 300x250 Static GIF, JPG, or PNG SWF with backup GIF/JPG (Flash 7 through 11.2; AS2 & AS3) 50K 30 seconds 4 minutes 24 FPS 300x60 Creatives Third-party, in-stream ads must be served via a linear VAST tag (pre-fetch tag) by a VAST vendor approved specifically for Ad Exchange. The VAST tag must comply with Google's XML summary for VAST ad server response. For each video ad served in the VAST tag, there needs to be a minimum of 2 separate nodes included - one for MP4 and WebM video formats. Other formats may be included, but will not be used. Consistent <AdSystem> Node Value: Please be sure that your all of your VAST tags include a specific consistent value for your company in the <AdSystem> node in the VAST XML. For example, Google would always include the following for all our VAST tags: <AdSystem>Google</AdSystem> Unique Ad ID Value: Each VAST tag generated should include a unique value for the “id” attribute in the node. Two different VAST tags should not have the same Ad id value. For instance: - VAST tag 1: <Ad id=\"3947179\"> - VAST tag 2: <Ad id=\"8741831\"> Note that only the following resource types will be allowed for node in the VAST XML: StaticResource: URI to a static file, such as an image or SWF file IFrameResource: URI source for an IFrame to display the companion element The HTMLResource type will no longer be permitted. For Google’s Flash SDK to serve video ads from a 3rd-party ad server, the 3rd-party ad server must include a crossdomain.xml with specifications to allow access to all specific Google domains or all domains. Also, the attribute secure needs to be set to “false”. The crossdomain.xml should be formatted as follows: <cross-domain-policy> <!-- Allow access to ALL domains <allow-access-from domain=\"*\" secure=\"false\"/> <!-- OR allow access to the domain from originating request </cross-domain-policy> Important: When you add a domain to your website's crossdomain.xml file, any Flash file hosted within that domain can access data belonging to users logged into your website. Due to this, you should generally not add advertising network hosts to crossdomain.xml files on websites that contain authenticated functionality such as user profiles. For Google’s HTML5 SDK to serve video ads from a third-party ad server, the third-party ad server must include a CORS header in all of its responses. The CORS header must be formatted as follows: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [allow access to the domain from originating request] OR Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Note: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * cannot be use in combination with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Audio is not allowed for companion ads. Creatives may not expand past ad unit boundaries. On all ads with partially black, white, or transparent backgrounds, you must add a visible border of a contrasting color to the majority background color of the creative. All creatives must be free of applications including, but not limited to, ActiveX, viruses, exit pops, spyware, and malware. Companion ads containing Flash must not exceed 50% of a user's CPU. Common causes of high CPU use are continued animation, heavy animation sequences, and animation that surpasses the 30-second limit. If applicable, you can use the Task Manager feature in Windows to check for compliance with this rule. Creative coding may not use cross-domain scripting or set cookies in unapproved domains. All creatives must open in new windows. The target window for the click-through URL must be set to \"_blank\" so the click-through will open in a new window. Do not leave the target statement undeclared. For Flash creatives: Creatives must be built to use Flash versions 7 through 11.2 (AS2 & AS3). You must supply a default image. If the browser doesn't support the Flash version used for your creative, the default image will be served. The last frame of the animation must include the following code in actionscript: \"stop()\". You must include a clickTag layer. The clickTag layer must be the topmost layer. You may use a maximum of 2 clickTags in a single creative. Creatives must support Google's click tracking. Where supported, all click events must be passed to Google. For VAST wrappers: No more than 2 (two) VAST wrapper redirects to 1 (one) VAST In-Line is permitted. Supported TrackingEvents (wrapper may include more than one node per each event): start firstQuartile midpoint thirdQuartile complete mute unmute pause resume For SSL-compliant VAST ads: A vendor must receive separate certification to serve VAST ads on SSL-compliant publisher inventory. All ad responses must be SSL-compliant (“HTTPS”). All servers involved require full SSL certification. It is preferred that your VAST tag can auto-detect that it is being requested from the HTTP/HTTPS protocol and will auto-adjust the URIs and companion banners to be SSL-compliant if necessary. Otherwise, Google has a protocol macro that we can insert in your VAST tag to auto-update “http” to “https” if necessary. The vendor/Ad Exchange buyer must ensure that any URIs within the VAST XML (e.g. the , , and other nodes) that are served by a party other than the primary VAST vendor are also from vendors approved by Google for SSL-compliant ad serving/tracking. The companion ad banner as well as any 4th-party calls to other technologies within the companion ad banner must also be made from SSL-compliant vendors that have been certified by Google. Ad Exchange buyers must declare through RTB or the Ad Exchange UI that the ad is SSL-compliant. Note that if an ad is declared as SSL- compliant but makes any non-SSL-compliant responses, the ad will be disapproved. VPAID will be available on non-GDN Ad Exchange inventory and must follow the following policies: Live feeds or User-Generated Content are not accepted. Overlays and other non-linear formats are not currently accepted. All VPAID tags must conform to all current Ad Exchange VAST 2.0 and 3.0 policies. General guidelines and editorial policies Google Ad Manager buyers must follow the same policies detailed in the Google Ads section on General guidelines and editorial policies. Pop-up windows Google Ad Manager buyers must following the same policies detailed in the Google Ads section on Pop-up windows. Audio effects Google Ad Manager buyers must following the same policies detailed in the Google Ads section on Audio effects. Personally-identifiable information Google Ad Manager buyers must follow the same policies detailed in the Google Ads section on Personally-identifiable information. Research If authorized by Google, you may implement research studies in connection with an ad campaign. If expressly approved by Google, these research studies may be exempt from some of the third-party serving restrictions outlined above. Research tags may not be used in in-app ad campaigns. All research must be conducted as follows: You may conduct research only for the purpose of measuring the effectiveness of mutually agreed-upon, ad-served advertising placements purchased through Google. You may only use a web beacon or other tracking mechanism in order to track a user's exposure to an ad. No surveys or survey invitations are allowed to be served on the Google Display Network via the Ad Exchange. When trafficking 3rd-party tags that serve surveys and survey invitations, the appropriate research vendor needs to be selected from the \"Ad Technology\" drop-down in the user interface. This will allow the survey and survey invitations to run on other AdX inventory, but not the Google Display Network. Google must approve, in writing, the public disclosure of any campaign-specific data and compilation or aggregation of data across multiple campaigns attributable to Google prior to any such disclosure. Only a third-party research provider that appears on Google's approved provider list may conduct research. You are responsible for ensuring that all survey results and associated data are kept strictly confidential, and that personally- identifiable data is not solicited or collected, except as necessary by you for granting incentives to research participants. All personally-identifiable data may be used only to deliver the relevant incentives, and such data must be destroyed promptly following delivery of the relevant incentives. If you are a verification or audience metric service provider, as classified by Google, you must be able to demonstrate that your service has gone through a formal third-party audit. Any data you collect must be used strictly for reporting against the advertiser's campaign. You must not collect site-level information (domain/URL) in connection with a cookie. You may not sell or make available for resale any information you may collect via your service to others. You may not share or aggregate data beyond the advertiser's campaign for whom you are providing the reporting. NOTE: Verification Services are not permitted to drop cookies. Verification and audience metric service providers may only be used for research and analytics purposes. You may not use any technology that will effect or prevent the serving of the ad, which includes but is not limited to services like ad blocking. Certification of these vendors only indicates that Google permits their use by clients on our network, but Google does not validate the accuracy of the data and analysis reported by any research vendors in our program including but not limited to verification and audience metric service providers. Google does not offer credits for any discrepancies between our reports and the third party's reports or for any issues flagged by these types of services. Online Behavioral Advertising Option Icon If you would like to display a third-party Advertising Option Icon for online behaviorally targeted ads, you must abide by the following requirements: If you choose to use a third-party Advertising Option Icon, the third-party vendor is responsible for complying to the requirements outlined by the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising (www.aboutads.info), which includes but is not limited to the following specifications: The layer must use the Advertising Option Icon’s official 76x15 “AdChoices” image.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. There are multiple factors that determine access to advanced ad formats and features on Google Ads. Some advertising features and formats aren’t available until you meet specific requirements or get certified to use them. Certification may include providing documentation, like supporting licenses and identification documentation to confirm that you're authorized to have access to the product features or that you have demonstrated a sustained history of policy compliance for some time. All ad formats and features are also subject to the standard Google Ads policies. The following ad formats are restricted unless your account meets the relevant requirements. HTML5 ads requirements Your Google Ads account must fulfill the minimum requirements below to be eligible to use HTML5 creatives: Account has been open for more than 90 days Account has more than $9,000 USD total lifetime spend Account has a good history of policy compliance If you meet the minimum requirements, you can Apply for HTML5 access. You’ll receive an email notification with a status update within 7 business days of your application submission. If your account meets the additional eligibility criteria below, your application may be approved for HTML5 access: Account has a good history of policy compliance Account has a good payment history Account has more than $1,000 USD total lifetime spend Meeting these requirements doesn’t guarantee access to HTML5 ads. You’ll need to avoid violating our policies, maintain a good history of policy compliance, and follow the correct display ads specifications to continue using HTML5 ads. If you don’t meet the requirements for using HTML5 ads, you can use other options like uploaded AMPHTML ads or responsive display ads. Click trackers Click tracker requirements You're only allowed to use click trackers that are certified by Google. Ads that use non-certified click trackers in the Tracking Template feature may be disapproved. Learn more about the list of certified Google click trackers. If you don’t want to use click trackers, you can use other tracking options like setting up an impression pixel on your landing page. Click tracker certification If you’re a click tracker service provider who meets the requirements highlighted in the guidelines for the certification program, you can apply for certification. When your application is approved by Google, advertisers can run ads using your clicktracking service without violating this policy. Google accepts applications for click tracker certification annually from September 1 until November 30. Set up your click tracker in the tracking template You'll need to add the next hop url to the redirect parameter (highlighted in bold) in the tracking template field as shown in the example below: https://your.tracker.com/?creative={creative}&device={device}&gclid={gclid}&redirect={your.landing.page.url} The specific format of the parameters may be different for different click tracker providers. Work with your click tracker provider to make sure you’re using the right format and to troubleshoot any setup issues. You can nest one or more click trackers within your primary click tracker. Each click tracker nested and the primary click tracker has to be certified and the next hop parameter must be clearly defined. Learn more about setting up your tracking template. General troubleshooting steps for click trackers Check the status of ads for more information about why they're disapproved, even if the click tracker is configured somewhere else, like on the Campaign level. Make sure that the click tracker is added in the tracking template field in the URL options. Verify that your click tracker is on the list of certified click trackers at the account, campaign, ad group, ad, or keyword level. When you make changes to your tracking template, your ads will be re-reviewed when those changes are saved. If your account has more than 100,000 affected ads, you should resubmit the most critical ones for review to expedite the process. Troubleshoot specific click tracker errors Click Tracker - Unsupported Ads using a non-certified click tracking service may be disapproved. To fix this issue, select one of the following: Remove the click tracker from Google Ads and consider using a landing page tracking pixel instead. Change to a certified click tracker. Refer to the list of certified Google click trackers to check that the click tracker you’re using is on the approved list. Ask your click tracker service provider to submit themselves for certification. When changes to ads are made and saved, the ads will be re-reviewed. If your click tracker service provider has become certified since your ads were most recently submitted, resubmit them. Click Tracker - Specific parameter needed Your click tracker requires further configuration to comply with Google’s Click Tracker Requirements. There are 2 ways to fix this issue: Consult your click tracker’s documentation for more information on how to use it with Google Ads. Edit your URL to comply, using feedback from the disapproval: Missing parameter: For example, if your tracking URL is https://tracker.example.com/track?sid=12345 and the disapproval states that the missing parameter is “&redirection_url={lpurl}”, edit your tracking template to contain “https://tracker.example.com/track?sid=12345&redirection_url={lpurl}” Remove parameter: If your tracking URL is “https://tracker.example.com/track?sid=12345&redirection_url={lpurl}&transparent=false” and the disapproval states that the parameter to be removed is “transparent”, edit your tracking template to contain “https://tracker.example.com/track?sid=12345&redirection_url={lpurl}”. This can look like “redirection_url=” or “redirection_url=...&transparent=true”, depending on the 3rd party service and what parameters they chose to certify with Google. Example: Tracking URL: https://tracker.com/?redirection_url=https://example.org/ or Tracking URL: https://tracker.com/?redirection_url=https://example.org/&force_transparent=true Reminder: Ads not using the correct parameters will be disapproved. Click Tracker - Incorrect path Your click tracker may support tracking different events, like impressions or clicks, or support multiple types of clicks. This disapproval means that the click tracker is being used to track the wrong event type. Consult your click tracker’s documentation for further information. Contact your click tracker provider to confirm which paths have been certified as transparent by Google. If URL conventions have changed, have them open a request to certify more paths and deprecate old ones. Click Tracker - Destination Mismatch Common causes for this error message include: The destination declared in the click tracker and final URL field don't match. For example, if the final URL is “https://example.org/” and the click tracker URL is “https://click.tracker.com/?redir=https://web.dev/”, and the disapproval reason is “https://web.dev/”, the Ad would be disapproved because users are sent somewhere other than the final URL. Edit your final URL or tracking template to make them match your intended destination. Your redirection target includes an uncertified click tracker. For example, if the final URL is “https://example.org/” and the click tracker URL is “https://click.tracker1.com/?redir=https://different-clicktracker.com/?url=https://example.org/” and the disapproval reason is “https://different-clicktracker.com/?url=https://example.org/”, the Ad would be disapproved because different-clicktracker.com is not certified.

        "content": "Restricted ad formats and features Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. There are multiple factors that determine access to advanced ad formats and features on Google Ads. Some advertising features and formats aren’t available until you meet specific requirements or get certified to use them. Certification may include providing documentation, like supporting licenses and identification documentation to confirm that you're authorized to have access to the product features or that you have demonstrated a sustained history of policy compliance for some time. All ad formats and features are also subject to the standard Google Ads policies. The following ad formats are restricted unless your account meets the relevant requirements. HTML5 ads requirements Your Google Ads account must fulfill the minimum requirements below to be eligible to use HTML5 creatives: Account has been open for more than 90 days Account has more than $9,000 USD total lifetime spend Account has a good history of policy compliance If you meet the minimum requirements, you can Apply for HTML5 access. You’ll receive an email notification with a status update within 7 business days of your application submission. If your account meets the additional eligibility criteria below, your application may be approved for HTML5 access: Account has a good history of policy compliance Account has a good payment history Account has more than $1,000 USD total lifetime spend Meeting these requirements doesn’t guarantee access to HTML5 ads. You’ll need to avoid violating our policies, maintain a good history of policy compliance, and follow the correct display ads specifications to continue using HTML5 ads. If you don’t meet the requirements for using HTML5 ads, you can use other options like uploaded AMPHTML ads or responsive display ads. Click trackers Click tracker requirements You're only allowed to use click trackers that are certified by Google. Ads that use non-certified click trackers in the Tracking Template feature may be disapproved. Learn more about the list of certified Google click trackers. If you don’t want to use click trackers, you can use other tracking options like setting up an impression pixel on your landing page. Click tracker certification If you’re a click tracker service provider who meets the requirements highlighted in the guidelines for the certification program, you can apply for certification. When your application is approved by Google, advertisers can run ads using your clicktracking service without violating this policy. Google accepts applications for click tracker certification annually from September 1 until November 30. Set up your click tracker in the tracking template You'll need to add the next hop url to the redirect parameter (highlighted in bold) in the tracking template field as shown in the example below: https://your.tracker.com/?creative={creative}&device={device}&gclid={gclid}&redirect={your.landing.page.url} The specific format of the parameters may be different for different click tracker providers. Work with your click tracker provider to make sure you’re using the right format and to troubleshoot any setup issues. You can nest one or more click trackers within your primary click tracker. Each click tracker nested and the primary click tracker has to be certified and the next hop parameter must be clearly defined. Learn more about setting up your tracking template. General troubleshooting steps for click trackers Check the status of ads for more information about why they're disapproved, even if the click tracker is configured somewhere else, like on the Campaign level. Make sure that the click tracker is added in the tracking template field in the URL options. Verify that your click tracker is on the list of certified click trackers at the account, campaign, ad group, ad, or keyword level. When you make changes to your tracking template, your ads will be re-reviewed when those changes are saved. If your account has more than 100,000 affected ads, you should resubmit the most critical ones for review to expedite the process. Troubleshoot specific click tracker errors Click Tracker - Unsupported Ads using a non-certified click tracking service may be disapproved. To fix this issue, select one of the following: Remove the click tracker from Google Ads and consider using a landing page tracking pixel instead. Change to a certified click tracker. Refer to the list of certified Google click trackers to check that the click tracker you’re using is on the approved list. Ask your click tracker service provider to submit themselves for certification. When changes to ads are made and saved, the ads will be re-reviewed. If your click tracker service provider has become certified since your ads were most recently submitted, resubmit them. Click Tracker - Specific parameter needed Your click tracker requires further configuration to comply with Google’s Click Tracker Requirements. There are 2 ways to fix this issue: Consult your click tracker’s documentation for more information on how to use it with Google Ads. Edit your URL to comply, using feedback from the disapproval: Missing parameter: For example, if your tracking URL is https://tracker.example.com/track?sid=12345 and the disapproval states that the missing parameter is “&redirection_url={lpurl}”, edit your tracking template to contain “https://tracker.example.com/track?sid=12345&redirection_url={lpurl}” Remove parameter: If your tracking URL is “https://tracker.example.com/track?sid=12345&redirection_url={lpurl}&transparent=false” and the disapproval states that the parameter to be removed is “transparent”, edit your tracking template to contain “https://tracker.example.com/track?sid=12345&redirection_url={lpurl}”. This can look like “redirection_url=” or “redirection_url=...&transparent=true”, depending on the 3rd party service and what parameters they chose to certify with Google. Example: Tracking URL: https://tracker.com/?redirection_url=https://example.org/ or Tracking URL: https://tracker.com/?redirection_url=https://example.org/&force_transparent=true Reminder: Ads not using the correct parameters will be disapproved. Click Tracker - Incorrect path Your click tracker may support tracking different events, like impressions or clicks, or support multiple types of clicks. This disapproval means that the click tracker is being used to track the wrong event type. Consult your click tracker’s documentation for further information. Contact your click tracker provider to confirm which paths have been certified as transparent by Google. If URL conventions have changed, have them open a request to certify more paths and deprecate old ones. Click Tracker - Destination Mismatch Common causes for this error message include: The destination declared in the click tracker and final URL field don't match. For example, if the final URL is “https://example.org/” and the click tracker URL is “https://click.tracker.com/?redir=https://web.dev/”, and the disapproval reason is “https://web.dev/”, the Ad would be disapproved because users are sent somewhere other than the final URL. Edit your final URL or tracking template to make them match your intended destination. Your redirection target includes an uncertified click tracker. For example, if the final URL is “https://example.org/” and the click tracker URL is “https://click.tracker1.com/?redir=https://different-clicktracker.com/?url=https://example.org/” and the disapproval reason is “https://different-clicktracker.com/?url=https://example.org/”, the Ad would be disapproved because different-clicktracker.com is not certified. All click trackers used must be certified, and this requirement applies to every click tracker between the tracking template and the final URL. After changes are made, you can appeal to submit ads for review: In your Google Ads account, click the Tools icon . Click the Troubleshooting drop down in the section menu. Click Policy manager.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Image assets are ad assets that allow you to upload rich, relevant images to complement your existing text ads. With compelling visuals of products or services that enhance the message of your text ad, image assets can help drive performance for your ads.

Effective landing pages are key to getting conversions from your Google Ads traffic. One of the best and easiest ways to get better results from your mobile ads is to improve the speed of your landing pages. It’s important to regularly check how your landing pages are performing to understand how people are interacting with your webpages. The best place to get an overview of this information is the “Landing pages” page. For example, in retail, we’ve seen that a 1-second delay in mobile can impact mobile conversions by up to 20 percent. How it works The \"Landing pages\" page gives you a performance breakdown for the pages you’re sending traffic to from your ads. This page reports on all landing page URLs from Search, Display, Video, and Shopping campaigns. For Search campaigns, the “Landing pages” report shows sitelink URLs in addition to headline URLs. This report shows sitelink URLs for all ads that were served, starting January 2021. Note about the “Landing pages” report for Search campaigns: Multiple sitelinks might show up for a single ad impression. Taking this into account, the report only counts the unique ad impressions as total impressions. On the “Landing pages” page, you can: Check the expanded landing pages associated with each of your landing pages. Identify which of your pages could provide a better experience on mobile devices.

This is part 1 of a 2-part series. In part 2, we'll cover optimizing your ads for mobile. Before you begin: Why mobile is important It's important for your website to work well on mobile devices, so if you haven't yet invested in making your website mobile-friendly, it's time to do so. Here are just a few reasons why your mobile presence is critical to your business: Mobile-friendly sites show up higher in search results Mobile searches make up more than half of searches on Google.com For many advertisers, the majority of traffic comes from people on their mobile phones If your site isn't mobile-friendly, visitors are 5 times more likely to leave Is your website mobile-friendly? Picture yourself as a potential customer and open your website on your phone. How fast does your website load? How easy is it to find what you're looking for? When someone visits your website on mobile, they'll expect answers right away. They'll want to quickly learn about your business and decide whether they're interested. Their experience on your website will heavily influence their impression of your business and the likelihood that they'll become a customer. Designing your website for mobile means focusing on simple, clear navigation that connects people to what they're looking for. Let's look at a few of the elements that make an effective mobile website: Does your site load quickly? Nearly half of all visitors will leave a mobile website if the pages don’t load within 3 seconds. Minimize loading time (the time it takes for a webpage to show up on your screen) so that visitors can quickly and easily navigate your website. Is it easy to navigate? On a smaller screen, it can be hard for people to find what they want. The more visitors have to hunt around or zoom in for information, the more likely they'll get frustrated and leave. You can help visitors find what they’re looking for by simplifying your site menu and trying to keep everything visible without having to zoom in to read. Is it easy to take action? Your mobile website should make it quick and easy for visitors to perform common tasks such as contacting you, searching for a product, or making a purchase. Try to minimize the number of steps it takes to complete a form or transaction. See how your site scores on mobile speed, and get quick fixes to improve it: Test your site Is your website designed for your specific business goal? While your mobile website might load quickly and be easy to navigate on mobile, its effectiveness depends on whether it spurs people to do business with you. To figure out how to optimize your website for mobile, think about the business goal that's most important to you. What do you want your customers to do on your website? Buy a specific product? Fill out a contact form? When you're clear about the action you want people to take on your website, visitors are more likely to actually take that action. Depending on your marketing goal, you'll want to focus on design improvements that encourage visitors to take your desired action. Here are a few goal-specific suggestions: Increase online sales Simplify site navigation. Streamline your site menu and try to keep everything visible without having to zoom in to read. Make info accessible. Help people explore before they commit to buy by using expandable product images. Help people make their purchase. Keep any directions or \"Buy now\" buttons front and center. If you can, use existing account info to limit data entry for your customers. Allow people to resume from a desktop. Make it easy for people to come back to their shopping cart when they're on their desktop computer, so they can finish their purchase. Get more phone calls Use click-to-call buttons or links. Avoid making people memorize your number or zoom in to see it. Condense your menu options. Make sure it's clear that calls are the best way to get in contact with your business. Show a clickable phone number or button on every page of your site. Avoid distractions. Keep promotions and other directions to the sidelines so people can focus on how to reach you by phone. Drive more online leads Simplify your forms. Make sure people can access your forms easily, and that data entry is limited and easy to do with thumbs. Limit scrolling and zooming. Your form should only take up the space available on a mobile screen. Scrolling and zooming make it hard for people to avoid mistakes while entering their info. Choose your data fields wisely. Make sure the information you're requesting in your form is simple to access and easy to validate. Use validation to show errors for incomplete fields. Encourage store visits Encourage visits above all. Make it clear that it's best for people to come to your physical store. Show a map, location button, or icon that links directly to your physical address and store hours on every page of the site. Keep content limited. Streamline your site's navigation to provide enough information to convince people to visit your store. Avoid distractions. Promotions can help convince people to visit your store, but they shouldn't make navigation more difficult. Information and awareness Simplify navigation. Use a simple menu and larger text to help people research before they commit to purchase. Because a mobile screen is smaller, condense your menu options so that people don't get overwhelmed. Keep consistency across devices. The longer it takes to for a customer to commit to buy, the more likely they are to continue researching on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, phone) before completing the transaction. No matter what device they’re using, help them pick up where they left off by saving their selections. Provide a home page link. If someone has hit a dead end in their research, make sure it’s easy for them to get back to the home page to start over. Working with your web developer There are different approaches to making your website mobile-friendly, so when it comes to designing and implementing changes, you'll want to work with your web developer to find the right solution. Most businesses choose to use responsive design, which means creating a website layout that flexibly adapts to different screen sizes, resolutions, and devices. Other business owners prefer to have separate versions of their website for desktop and mobile. We recommend working with your web developer to see what makes the most sense for your business, website needs, and web developer resources.

        "content": "Mobile Advertising assessment study guide Optimize your website for mobile Next: Optimize your ads for mobile In this article, we'll share some guidance on making your website more mobile-friendly. This is part 1 of a 2-part series. In part 2, we'll cover optimizing your ads for mobile. Before you begin: Why mobile is important It's important for your website to work well on mobile devices, so if you haven't yet invested in making your website mobile-friendly, it's time to do so. Here are just a few reasons why your mobile presence is critical to your business: Mobile-friendly sites show up higher in search results Mobile searches make up more than half of searches on Google.com For many advertisers, the majority of traffic comes from people on their mobile phones If your site isn't mobile-friendly, visitors are 5 times more likely to leave Is your website mobile-friendly? Picture yourself as a potential customer and open your website on your phone. How fast does your website load? How easy is it to find what you're looking for? When someone visits your website on mobile, they'll expect answers right away. They'll want to quickly learn about your business and decide whether they're interested. Their experience on your website will heavily influence their impression of your business and the likelihood that they'll become a customer. Designing your website for mobile means focusing on simple, clear navigation that connects people to what they're looking for. Let's look at a few of the elements that make an effective mobile website: Does your site load quickly? Nearly half of all visitors will leave a mobile website if the pages don’t load within 3 seconds. Minimize loading time (the time it takes for a webpage to show up on your screen) so that visitors can quickly and easily navigate your website. Is it easy to navigate? On a smaller screen, it can be hard for people to find what they want. The more visitors have to hunt around or zoom in for information, the more likely they'll get frustrated and leave. You can help visitors find what they’re looking for by simplifying your site menu and trying to keep everything visible without having to zoom in to read. Is it easy to take action? Your mobile website should make it quick and easy for visitors to perform common tasks such as contacting you, searching for a product, or making a purchase. Try to minimize the number of steps it takes to complete a form or transaction. See how your site scores on mobile speed, and get quick fixes to improve it: Test your site Is your website designed for your specific business goal? While your mobile website might load quickly and be easy to navigate on mobile, its effectiveness depends on whether it spurs people to do business with you. To figure out how to optimize your website for mobile, think about the business goal that's most important to you. What do you want your customers to do on your website? Buy a specific product? Fill out a contact form? When you're clear about the action you want people to take on your website, visitors are more likely to actually take that action. Depending on your marketing goal, you'll want to focus on design improvements that encourage visitors to take your desired action. Here are a few goal-specific suggestions: Increase online sales Simplify site navigation. Streamline your site menu and try to keep everything visible without having to zoom in to read. Make info accessible. Help people explore before they commit to buy by using expandable product images. Help people make their purchase. Keep any directions or \"Buy now\" buttons front and center. If you can, use existing account info to limit data entry for your customers. Allow people to resume from a desktop. Make it easy for people to come back to their shopping cart when they're on their desktop computer, so they can finish their purchase. Get more phone calls Use click-to-call buttons or links. Avoid making people memorize your number or zoom in to see it. Condense your menu options. Make sure it's clear that calls are the best way to get in contact with your business. Show a clickable phone number or button on every page of your site. Avoid distractions. Keep promotions and other directions to the sidelines so people can focus on how to reach you by phone. Drive more online leads Simplify your forms. Make sure people can access your forms easily, and that data entry is limited and easy to do with thumbs. Limit scrolling and zooming. Your form should only take up the space available on a mobile screen. Scrolling and zooming make it hard for people to avoid mistakes while entering their info. Choose your data fields wisely. Make sure the information you're requesting in your form is simple to access and easy to validate. Use validation to show errors for incomplete fields. Encourage store visits Encourage visits above all. Make it clear that it's best for people to come to your physical store. Show a map, location button, or icon that links directly to your physical address and store hours on every page of the site. Keep content limited. Streamline your site's navigation to provide enough information to convince people to visit your store. Avoid distractions.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. To ensure a safe and positive experience for users, Google requires that advertisers comply with all applicable laws and regulations in addition to the Google Ads policies. Ads, assets, destinations, and other content that violate these policies can be blocked on the Google Ads platform and associated networks. How does Google Ads detect policy violations? We use a combination of Google's AI and human evaluation to detect and remove ads and accounts which violate our policies and are harmful to users and the overall Google Ads ecosystem. Our enforcement technologies use Google's AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. The policy-violating content is either blocked from serving by our automated models or, where a more nuanced determination is required, it is flagged for further review by trained operators and analysts who conduct content evaluations that might be difficult for algorithms to perform alone, for example because an understanding of the context of the ad and account is required. The results of these manual reviews are then used to help build training data to further improve our machine learning models. In determining whether an advertiser or destination is violating our policies, we review information from a variety of sources, including ads, accounts, websites, content, user complaints, consumer reviews, regulatory warnings and rulings, and other third-party sources. Below is a list of various ways we enforce policies and laws. Ad or asset disapproval Ads and assets that don't follow Google Ads policies will be disapproved. A disapproved ad won't be able to run until the policy violation is fixed and the ad is reviewed. In Google Ads, this will be noted in the \"Status\" column. Learn how to fix a disapproved ad Ad serving eligibility An ad will be marked \"Eligible (limited all locations)\" when Google Ads policies (common examples include Alcohol, Copyrights, Gambling, Healthcare, and Trademarks) prevent certain types of ads from showing in your targeted locations. Depending on the policy topic, available certification and verification programs, and target country, the ads can serve on a limited basis. Learn more about ad serving eligibility. Account suspension Accounts may be suspended if we find violations of our policies or the Terms & Conditions. If we detect an egregious violation, your account will be suspended immediately without prior warning. An egregious violation of the Google Ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users or our digital advertising ecosystem. Egregious violations often reflect that the advertiser's overall business does not adhere to Google Ads policies or that one violation is so severe that we cannot risk future exposure to our users. Given that egregious violations will cause immediate account suspension, upon detection and without prior warning, we limit these to cases when such action is the only effective method to adequately prevent illegal activity and/or significant user harm. For other violations that lead to account suspension, we will send you a warning to outline the nature of the policy violation and any remedial action that can be taken, in order to comply. This notification will be sent at least 7 days before suspension action. For repeat violations of a policy, we issue strikes to your Google ads account and penalties progressively increase with each subsequent strike leading up to account suspension. You will receive a maximum of 3 strikes per policy on your Google Ads account. Learn more about enforcement procedures for repeat violations. If we suspend your account, all ads in the suspended account will stop running, and we will no longer accept advertising from you, unless successfully appealed. Any related accounts (for example, accounts using the same payment method) will also be suspended, and any new accounts you create will be automatically suspended. Learn more about suspended accounts. Remarketing list disabling Remarketing lists that don’t follow the Personalized advertising policy may be disabled. These lists can no longer be used with ad campaigns, and new users won’t be added to the lists. List creation restrictions may apply to both individual web pages and entire websites or apps. Compliance review We may review your business for compliance with the Customer Match policy at any time. If we contact you to request information related to compliance, you're required to respond in a timely manner and swiftly take any corrective action needed to follow our policies. If you have a manager account, we may also contact your managed accounts to verify compliance.

This may include disapproving ads so they don’t serve, as well as suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and continue to expand a strike system for repeat offenders. Strikes are issued to your Google Ads account when you repeatedly violate certain Google Ads policies. Note that no strikes are issued for the first policy violation. You will be able to receive a maximum of 3 strikes, and the penalties applied with each strike will progressively increase. Temporary account holds will be applied for the first and second strikes (for 3 and 7 days respectively), while the third strike will result in an account suspension. This strike-based system applies to the following policies: Enabling dishonest behavior, Unapproved substances, Guns, gun parts and related products, Explosives, Other Weapons, Tobacco, Compensated sexual acts, Mail-order brides, Clickbait, Misleading ad design, Bail bond services, Call directories, forwarding, and recording services, Credit repair services, Binary options, and Personal loans. What happens if you get a strike A strike is issued to your Google Ads account via an email and an in-account notification when your assets or ads violate a Google Ads policy multiple times. An account can receive a maximum of one warning and 3 strikes per policy violation. Warning We understand mistakes happen and you don’t mean to violate our policies — that’s why the first violation is only a warning. Note that you’ll only be warned once through an email notification. The next time your ads violate a Google Ads policy, you'll get a strike. If you think we made a mistake, you can appeal the disapproved ads. Read more about appeals here. First Strike You will earn your first strike when we detect that you have continued to violate a specific Google Ads policy, even after receiving an initial warning. Your account will be in a temporary hold state for 3 days when you receive the first strike. If you take no action to either acknowledge or appeal the strike, your account will continue to remain on hold. See more information in the “What to do if you get a Strike” section. Accounts in a temporary hold state cannot run any ads. Advertisers can, however, still access their accounts and all associated reports. Learn more about temporary account hold. Second Strike You will receive a second strike if you violate the same policy again within 90 days of the first strike. It will serve as the last and final notice for you to remove all policy violating assets or ads in your Google Ads account to avoid being suspended. Your account will be in a temporary hold state for 7 days upon receiving the second strike. If you take no action to either acknowledge or appeal the strike, your account will continue to remain on hold. See more information in the “What to do if you get a Strike” section. Accounts in a temporary hold state cannot run any ads. Advertisers can, however, still access their accounts and all associated reports. Learn more about temporary account hold. We will send you an email notification when your account is released from temporary hold. Third Strike You will receive a third and final strike if you violate the same policy within 90 days of the second strike. Your account will then be suspended for repeat violation of our policies. Learn more about account suspensions. What to do if you get a strike Your account may be in a temporary hold state or suspended. The temporary hold state or suspension is determined by the number of strikes accumulated in your account for a given policy. If your account is in a temporary hold state To resume serving ads, you will be required to correct the violations and to submit an acknowledgement form. If you believe there has been an error and that you haven’t violated our policies, you will need to appeal the strike. Note that your account will continue to remain on hold until you take action to either acknowledge or appeal the strike. If you choose to appeal the strike and it is unsuccessful, you’d still be required to remove or fix the policy violations and acknowledge the strike to release your account from a temporary hold state. Acknowledgement of the strike To acknowledge the strike, you must remove or fix all policy violations in your account and complete the acknowledgement form. By completing the acknowledgement form, you affirm that: You are aware of the specific policy or policies that led to a strike being issued on the account, that you have reviewed the policies in question, and that you understand that additional violations of these policies can lead to more severe action, up to and including account suspension. You have removed the assets and ads that violate the policies in question and you will ensure that future assets and ads will comply with our policies. Creating additional accounts and/or attempting to circumvent Google’s policy enforcement is strictly prohibited and can lead to account suspension. Once the acknowledgement form is submitted, your account will resume serving ads within a specific period of time, depending on the number of strikes accumulated. For the first strike, your account will resume serving ads 3 days after the temporary hold was initiated. For the second strike, your account will resume serving ads 7 days after the temporary hold was initiated. If you are modifying existing ads or uploading new ads, please ensure that they comply with the relevant policy. If you create new policy violating ads while your account is in a temporary hold state, you will be issued an additional strike. Google will continue to monitor your account for repeat violations of our Ads policies. Appeal If you successfully appeal the strike, it will be removed from your account and the compliant ads will be approved. Your account will be released from temporary hold immediately. If your appeal is unsuccessful, your account will continue to remain in a hold state until you fix all policy violations in your account and complete the acknowledgement form. If your account is suspended If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy, please submit an appeal to explain why. We only reinstate accounts under compelling circumstances, so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest. Learn more about suspended accounts.

Egregious policy violations What is an egregious policy violation? An egregious violation of the Google Ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users or our digital advertising ecosystem. Egregious violations often reflect that the advertiser's overall business does not adhere to Google Ads policies or that one violation is so severe that we cannot risk future exposure to our users. Given that egregious violations will cause immediate account suspension, upon detection and without prior warning, we limit these to cases when such action is the only effective method to adequately prevent illegal activity and significant user harm. What happens if an egregious violation is detected? If we detect an egregious violation, we will suspend your Google Ads accounts immediately without prior warning. You will not be allowed to advertise with us again. How many times can advertisers appeal their account suspension status? If you file too many appeals for the same account suspension, we may not process them to ensure the overall stability of our systems operations. Submitting one appeal at a time ensures timely response and review. If we have indications that you are misusing our appeals function, we will suspend processing of certain appeals for 7 days. Which policies are considered to be egregious? Circumventing systems Coordinated deceptive practices Counterfeit Malicious software Prescription opioid painkillers Promotion of unauthorized pharmacies Unacceptable business practices Trade sanctions violation Sexually explicit content Fix your suspended account If you believe there’s been an error and that you haven’t violated Google Ads' policies, submit an appeal. In your Google Ads account, click the Contact Us link in the notification at the top of your screen. This link will direct you to the appeal form on the right side of your screen. While you complete the form, relevant policy information will appear to help you understand the reason for the suspension and the appeal process. If you select Contact Us again while your appeal is still being processed, your Google Ads account will have an “Appeal pending” status. When your appeal is reviewed, you'll receive an email with the outcome. If your appeal is rejected, you can re-appeal following the same process outlined above. Certain selected advertisers must complete advertiser verification successfully to appeal their account suspension. If Google isn't able to verify their identity after 3 attempts, they won't be allowed to appeal their account suspension. Advertisers suspended for Billing and Payment suspensions may be asked to verify their payment method to process their appeals. Accounts are only reinstated in compelling circumstances, such as in the case of a mistake, so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest. Get started Tips for submitting your appeal Follow best practices: Implement the best practices we’ve provided if you haven’t already. Refer to each egregious policy page for more information on best practices and relevant tips for what to include in your appeal submission. Explain your situation: For each violating policy, provide more context into your Examples: For cloaking violations, let us know why you were showing different content to Google than to other users. For phishing violations, if you're an official partner of another brand, describe your partnership and share any information that shows how you're connected Verify your identity: If we’ve asked you to, make sure you complete advertiser verification. Additional rights under the EU Digital Services Act Users and advertisers located in the EU may have additional redress options. Read more about those potential options here. Frequently asked questions How does Google Ads detect policy violations? We use a combination of Google's AI and human evaluation to detect and remove ads and accounts which violate our policies and are harmful to users and the overall Google Ads ecosystem. Our enforcement technologies use Google's AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. The policy-violating content is either blocked from serving by our automated models or, where a more nuanced determination is required, it is flagged for further review by trained operators and analysts who conduct content evaluations that might be difficult for algorithms to perform alone, for example because an understanding of the context of the ad and account is required. The results of these manual reviews are then used to help build training data to further improve our machine learning models. We take action on ads that violate our policies. This may include disapproving ads so they don’t serve, and suspending or pausing accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and continue to expand a strike system for repeat offenders. In determining whether an advertiser or destination is violating our policies, we review information from a variety of sources, including ads, accounts, websites, content, user complaints, consumer reviews, regulatory warnings and rulings, and other third-party sources. Are there any other policy violations that can lead to an account suspension? Yes. Violations of any Google Ads policy can lead to an account suspension. If an advertiser violates or repeatedly violates a Google Ads advertising policy, we will send a warning to outline the nature of the policy violation and any remedial action that can be taken, in order to comply. At that time, the advertiser will be given an opportunity to remedy the violation or, if they do not believe they have violated the policy, explain why they do not believe they are in violation of the policy. This notification will be sent at least 7 days before suspension action. Repeated violations is a strike-based system. Strikes are issued to your Google Ads account when you repeatedly violate certain Google Ads policies. Note that no strikes are issued for the first policy violation. You'll receive a maximum of three strikes, and the penalties applied with each strike will progressively increase. Temporary account holds will be applied for the first and second strikes (for three and seven days respectively), while the third strike will result in an account suspension. Learn more about enforcement procedures for repeat violations. How will an advertiser be notified of a suspension? Advertisers whose accounts are suspended will receive an in-account notification and an email notification. The email notification will identify all policies the advertiser has been suspended for violating and a link to submit an appeal. For repeat violations of a policy, we issue strikes to your Google ads account and penalties progressively increase with each subsequent strike leading up to account suspension. You will receive a maximum of 3 strikes per policy on your Google Ads account. Learn more about enforcement procedures for repeat violations. If we suspend your account, all ads in the suspended account will stop running, and you will no longer be able to advertise from your suspended account until the account is reinstated. Do account suspensions apply globally? All Google Ads accounts, irrespective of location, may be subject to account suspensions if found to be in violation of our policies or Terms and Conditions. Suspended accounts are prohibited from serving and showing ads in all locations. How long is the Google Ads account suspended for? Once the Google Ads account is suspended, this is considered permanent unless the appeal is submitted and the account is successfully reinstated. All advertisers have at least 6 months from the date of account suspension to submit an appeal. Can an account suspension be appealed? Yes. If you believe there’s been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policies, submit an appeal. To appeal multiple suspensions for your accounts and related accounts, please submit a separate appeal for each suspended account. In each appeal, include any relevant information and an explanation of why you believe the suspension is incorrect. If your account was suspended because other accounts verified using the same identity documents were suspended, your account will be automatically reinstated once those other accounts are successfully appealed. Before appealing, please ensure that all linked (or previously linked) and all related accounts comply with Google's policies, as outlined in our Terms of Service. Certain selected advertisers must complete advertiser verification successfully in order to appeal their account suspension. If we are unable to verify their identity after 3 attempts, they will not be allowed to appeal their account suspension. We only reinstate accounts in compelling circumstances, such as in the case of a mistake, so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest. Can a suspended advertiser set up or use other accounts? Accounts related to the suspended account may be suspended. We take the safety of users very seriously, so advertiser actions that put our users, Google, or our partners at risk result in a ban from using Google Ads. In addition any new accounts that the advertiser tries to create may also be suspended. We highly recommend that advertisers reinstate all the suspended ads accounts first, before attempting to create new accounts. Can an advertiser access their suspended accounts? Suspended accounts cannot run any ads. Advertisers can still view their suspended accounts and any associated reports. However, advertisers may not be able to access suspended accounts after an extended period. How to request a refund If your account was suspended, and you qualify for a refund, you can always cancel your account and receive your refund. Cancel your account Request a refund What account actions are available to advertisers with suspended accounts? Suspended accounts are in read-only mode, with a few exceptions. Advertisers will still be able to access their accounts but will be limited to the following actions: Account settings: Cancel account, claim refunds Billing options: Make a payment, download tax documents, add a payment method.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. When you have an ad with policy violations, you’ll want to review the policy and fix the ad to get it running again.

Please note that the duration for policy restrictions is permanent and the territorial restriction is global unless otherwise specified.

For example (non-exhaustive): An ad labeled for Complex Speculative Financial Products, serving in Singapore, run by an account with Complex Speculative Financial Products certification for Singapore, will have the “Eligible: Limited” status. The ad will serve to users in Singapore, provided the ad and landing page are compliant with all other Complex Speculative Financial Products guidelines. However, there may be other scenarios where you’ll need to appeal your ad for further review. If your ad is disapproved due to issues in your destination, you’ll need to fix your destination, and then appeal.

Or there may be issues with your destination: For example (non-exhaustive): Your destination has content that’s not allowed.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. When you have an ad with policy violations, you’ll want to review the policy and fix the ad to get it running again. Once you fix your ad, we'll review the ad and allow it to run if it’s compliant with policy. Please note that the duration for policy restrictions is permanent and the territorial restriction is global unless otherwise specified. This article explains how to find out if your ad is disapproved or limited by policy, why your ad is disapproved or Eligible (limited), and how to edit your ads and resubmit your ad for review. Additionally you will learn how to appeal a policy decision. To appeal DV360 ads, refer to this page. Ads can be compliant with policies, and still receive policy labels. If your ad is labeled for a policy, but is targeting countries/regions where these policies don’t apply, your ad would serve. For example (non-exhaustive): An ad labeled for Alcohol Information, targeting the US, would have the “Eligible Limited” status. The ad would serve as normal to US users, in line with our Alcohol policy’s Ad network, platform, and format requirements. If your ad is labeled for a policy, but you are appropriately certified to serve ads for that policy, your ad will serve. For example (non-exhaustive): An ad labeled for Complex Speculative Financial Products, serving in Singapore, run by an account with Complex Speculative Financial Products certification for Singapore, will have the “Eligible: Limited” status. The ad will serve to users in Singapore, provided the ad and landing page are compliant with all other Complex Speculative Financial Products guidelines. However, there may be other scenarios where you’ll need to appeal your ad for further review. If your ad is disapproved due to issues in your destination, you’ll need to fix your destination, and then appeal. If you’ve reviewed the policy and believe your ad is compliant with the policy, you’ll want to appeal. This article also explains how to take these steps. To learn more about how to check ads for policy violations and what different ad statuses mean, read Check your ad’s policy review status. How to check ads for policy violations Check for policy violations from your Google Ads account Check the status of an ad or group In your Google Ads account, click the Campaigns icon . Click the Campaigns drop down in the section menu. Click Ads or Ad groups. Review the \"Status\" column for the current status of your ad or ad group. Check the status of an asset In your Google Ads account, click the Campaigns icon . Click the Assets drop down in the section menu. Click Assets. Review the \"Status\" column for the current status of your asset. Check detailed policy information of an ad or asset The \"Policy details\" column provides information about why a disapproved ad isn't \"Eligible\", or why an \"Eligible (limited)\" ad is limited to a certain audience. You can add the “Policy details\" column to the Ads or Assets table by following the steps below. From the table on the Ads or Assets page in your Google Ads account, click the Columns icon above the statistics table. Click to expand the Attributes section. Click Policy details. Click Apply. The “Policy details” column will now appear in your statistics table. Check for policy violations from an ad disapproval email notification Click the View and fix policy issues button provided in the email. Click View ads for the flagged policy to view more information in Policy Manager. To check an ad or asset status, review the “Status” column. If you hover over each status, you’ll notice a more detailed explanation of the policy violation. Click Read the policy under the disapproval reason to learn how to fix your ad. Fix your ad The steps to fix your ad depend on the policy violation impacting your ad. Your ad itself may be non-compliant with specific Google Ads policies: For example (non-exhaustive): Your ad is disapproved for punctuations and symbols under the Editorial policy because repeated punctuation or symbols were used in the ad headlines. Or there may be issues with your destination: For example (non-exhaustive): Your destination has content that’s not allowed. Note: In addition to complying with all other policies, ad destinations must meet our Destination Requirements. If all content on your destination is compliant, check your destination to determine if a technical issue is causing the disapproval and work with your webmaster to make any necessary changes before proceeding. For example (non-exhaustive): Your destination is not working, or your destination is not crawlable. First, check which policy is affecting your ad, and then follow the applicable steps below. Note: For video or image ads, please review the video and image ad requirements. If your ad is not affected by policies related to the destination, follow these steps to fix the ad: In your Google Ads account, click the Campaigns icon . Click the Campaigns drop down in the section menu. Click Ads. Hover over the ad or asset and click Edit. Edit the ad or asset so that it complies with the policy. Click Save. Your ad will automatically be reviewed again. You can check the status of your appeal by reviewing the “Status” column or using the Policy Manager. To resolve policy issues for Related videos, remove the videos, save your changes, and upload them again to initiate a new review. Appeal policy decision The option to appeal a policy decision directly from your Google Ads account is now available for most formats and policies. For any unsupported formats and policies, you can dispute policy decisions using the Disapproved ads and policy questions form. If you’ve fixed your ad and destination or believe that we’ve made an error, appeal the policy decision directly from your Google Ads account to request a review. You may appeal ads in batches for specific ad groups or campaigns. If you attempt to appeal all ads in your account at once, you may experience longer review times. Follow the instructions provided to Submit a campaign for policy review. Please also ensure that an appeal for the same ad groups or campaigns or for all ads in your account is made at least 24 hours after the previous appeal to avoid appeal requests from being marked as duplicate. If we have indications that you may be misusing our appeals function, we will suspend the processing of certain appeals until you reach out to customer support. For example, the appeal limit for each ad is 3 times. If you appeal 3 times unsuccessfully, we will not process additional appeals on the same ad. If you still believe your ad is policy compliant, please reach out to customer support. In addition, if you submit too many unique appeals within a 24-hour window, we will suspend processing of additional appeals during that window. Tip: Appeals via “Made changes to comply with policy” are reviewed by the system and “Dispute decision” are reviewed by our ad reviewers. For example (non-exhaustive): If you’ve made changes on your landing pages to comply with policies such as Destination not working and Restricted Drug Terms, you would select “Made changes to comply with policy” under \"Reason for appealing\". For example (non-exhaustive): If you believe that we’ve made an error on the disapproval, you would select “Dispute Decision” under \"Reason for appealing\". From here, there are 3 ways to appeal. How to appeal policy decisions from the “Policy manager” In your Google Ads account, click the Tools icon . Click the Troubleshooting drop down in the section menu. Click Policy manager. On the “Policy issues” tab, find the ad you want to appeal, then click Appeal. Under \"Reason for appealing,\" select Dispute decision or Made changes to comply with policy. Click Submit. How to appeal policy decisions from the Assets page Select the ads you want to appeal. From the menu at the top, select Edit. Click Appeal. If any of the ads you selected aren’t eligible for appeal, you’ll receive a message showing which ads aren’t eligible. Under \"Reason for appealing\", select Dispute decision or Made changes to comply with policy. Under \"Appeal the following\", select which ads you want to appeal. Click Submit. How to appeal policy decisions from an ad's \"Status\" column In the “Status” column of the ad you want to dispute, hover over the ad status, and click Appeal. Under \"Reason for appealing\", select Dispute decision or Made changes to comply with policy. Under \"Appeal the following\", select which ads you want to appeal. Click Submit. Check appeal status After appealing, you can always check on the review status in the Policy Manager. In your Google Ads account, click the Tools icon . Click Troubleshooting, then click Policy manager. On the “Appeal history” tab, you’ll find details for all ads you’ve appealed. The “Status” column shows whether the appeal is still in progress or complete. Review complete: Your review is now complete. Review the “Results” column for more details. In progress: Your appeal is currently under review. Please check back in 24 hours. Not reviewed: Your appeal was not reviewed. Review the “Results” column for more details. The “Results” column shows the results of the appeal, including how many ads had their policy review status updated after the review. If you submit the same appeal too many times, you may notice the status \"Exceeded appeal retry-limit\" in the \"Appeal history\" tab within Policy Manager. Please contact customer support for assistance with filing a new appeal. Successful: The policy appealed no longer applies to any of the ads that were reviewed.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. When you have an ad with policy violations, you’ll want to review the policy and fix the ad to get it running again. Once you fix your ad, we'll review the ad and allow it to run if it’s compliant with policy. Please note that the duration for policy restrictions is permanent and the territorial restriction is global unless otherwise specified. This article explains how to find out if your ad is disapproved or limited by policy, why your ad is disapproved or Eligible (limited), and how to edit your ads and resubmit your ad for review. Additionally you will learn how to appeal a policy decision. To appeal DV360 ads, refer to this page. Ads can be compliant with policies, and still receive policy labels. If your ad is labeled for a policy, but is targeting countries/regions where these policies don’t apply, your ad would serve. For example (non-exhaustive): An ad labeled for Alcohol Information, targeting the US, would have the “Eligible Limited” status. The ad would serve as normal to US users, in line with our Alcohol policy’s Ad network, platform, and format requirements. If your ad is labeled for a policy, but you are appropriately certified to serve ads for that policy, your ad will serve. For example (non-exhaustive): An ad labeled for Complex Speculative Financial Products, serving in Singapore, run by an account with Complex Speculative Financial Products certification for Singapore, will have the “Eligible: Limited” status. The ad will serve to users in Singapore, provided the ad and landing page are compliant with all other Complex Speculative Financial Products guidelines. However, there may be other scenarios where you’ll need to appeal your ad for further review. If your ad is disapproved due to issues in your destination, you’ll need to fix your destination, and then appeal. If you’ve reviewed the policy and believe your ad is compliant with the policy, you’ll want to appeal. This article also explains how to take these steps. To learn more about how to check ads for policy violations and what different ad statuses mean, read Check your ad’s policy review status. How to check ads for policy violations Check for policy violations from your Google Ads account Check the status of an ad or group In your Google Ads account, click the Campaigns icon . Click the Campaigns drop down in the section menu. Click Ads or Ad groups. Review the \"Status\" column for the current status of your ad or ad group. Check the status of an asset In your Google Ads account, click the Campaigns icon . Click the Assets drop down in the section menu. Click Assets. Review the \"Status\" column for the current status of your asset. Check detailed policy information of an ad or asset The \"Policy details\" column provides information about why a disapproved ad isn't \"Eligible\", or why an \"Eligible (limited)\" ad is limited to a certain audience. You can add the “Policy details\" column to the Ads or Assets table by following the steps below. From the table on the Ads or Assets page in your Google Ads account, click the Columns icon above the statistics table. Click to expand the Attributes section. Click Policy details. Click Apply. The “Policy details” column will now appear in your statistics table. Check for policy violations from an ad disapproval email notification Click the View and fix policy issues button provided in the email. Click View ads for the flagged policy to view more information in Policy Manager. To check an ad or asset status, review the “Status” column. If you hover over each status, you’ll notice a more detailed explanation of the policy violation. Click Read the policy under the disapproval reason to learn how to fix your ad. Fix your ad The steps to fix your ad depend on the policy violation impacting your ad. Your ad itself may be non-compliant with specific Google Ads policies: For example (non-exhaustive): Your ad is disapproved for punctuations and symbols under the Editorial policy because repeated punctuation or symbols were used in the ad headlines. Or there may be issues with your destination: For example (non-exhaustive): Your destination has content that’s not allowed. Note: In addition to complying with all other policies, ad destinations must meet our Destination Requirements. If all content on your destination is compliant, check your destination to determine if a technical issue is causing the disapproval and work with your webmaster to make any necessary changes before proceeding. For example (non-exhaustive): Your destination is not working, or your destination is not crawlable. First, check which policy is affecting your ad, and then follow the applicable steps below. Note: For video or image ads, please review the video and image ad requirements. If your ad is not affected by policies related to the destination, follow these steps to fix the ad: In your Google Ads account, click the Campaigns icon . Click the Campaigns drop down in the section menu. Click Ads. Hover over the ad or asset and click Edit. Edit the ad or asset so that it complies with the policy. Click Save. Your ad will automatically be reviewed again. You can check the status of your appeal by reviewing the “Status” column or using the Policy Manager. To resolve policy issues for Related videos, remove the videos, save your changes, and upload them again to initiate a new review. Appeal policy decision The option to appeal a policy decision directly from your Google Ads account is now available for most formats and policies. For any unsupported formats and policies, you can dispute policy decisions using the Disapproved ads and policy questions form. If you’ve fixed your ad and destination or believe that we’ve made an error, appeal the policy decision directly from your Google Ads account to request a review. You may appeal ads in batches for specific ad groups or campaigns. If you attempt to appeal all ads in your account at once, you may experience longer review times. Follow the instructions provided to Submit a campaign for policy review. Please also ensure that an appeal for the same ad groups or campaigns or for all ads in your account is made at least 24 hours after the previous appeal to avoid appeal requests from being marked as duplicate. If we have indications that you may be misusing our appeals function, we will suspend the processing of certain appeals until you reach out to customer support. For example, the appeal limit for each ad is 3 times. If you appeal 3 times unsuccessfully, we will not process additional appeals on the same ad. If you still believe your ad is policy compliant, please reach out to customer support. In addition, if you submit too many unique appeals within a 24-hour window, we will suspend processing of additional appeals during that window. Tip: Appeals via “Made changes to comply with policy” are reviewed by the system and “Dispute decision” are reviewed by our ad reviewers. For example (non-exhaustive): If you’ve made changes on your landing pages to comply with policies such as Destination not working and Restricted Drug Terms, you would select “Made changes to comply with policy” under \"Reason for appealing\". For example (non-exhaustive): If you believe that we’ve made an error on the disapproval, you would select “Dispute Decision” under \"Reason for appealing\". From here, there are 3 ways to appeal. How to appeal policy decisions from the “Policy manager” In your Google Ads account, click the Tools icon . Click the Troubleshooting drop down in the section menu. Click Policy manager. On the “Policy issues” tab, find the ad you want to appeal, then click Appeal. Under \"Reason for appealing,\" select Dispute decision or Made changes to comply with policy. Click Submit. How to appeal policy decisions from the Assets page Select the ads you want to appeal. From the menu at the top, select Edit. Click Appeal. If any of the ads you selected aren’t eligible for appeal, you’ll receive a message showing which ads aren’t eligible. Under \"Reason for appealing\", select Dispute decision or Made changes to comply with policy. Under \"Appeal the following\", select which ads you want to appeal. Click Submit. How to appeal policy decisions from an ad's \"Status\" column In the “Status” column of the ad you want to dispute, hover over the ad status, and click Appeal. Under \"Reason for appealing\", select Dispute decision or Made changes to comply with policy. Under \"Appeal the following\", select which ads you want to appeal. Click Submit. Check appeal status After appealing, you can always check on the review status in the Policy Manager. In your Google Ads account, click the Tools icon . Click Troubleshooting, then click Policy manager. On the “Appeal history” tab, you’ll find details for all ads you’ve appealed. The “Status” column shows whether the appeal is still in progress or complete. Review complete: Your review is now complete. Review the “Results” column for more details. In progress: Your appeal is currently under review. Please check back in 24 hours. Not reviewed: Your appeal was not reviewed. Review the “Results” column for more details. The “Results” column shows the results of the appeal, including how many ads had their policy review status updated after the review.

        "content": "Google Publisher Restrictions We are in the process of migrating and consolidating all of the Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions to the new Publisher Policies Help Center. For now, you can still view all the policies in the AdMob, AdSense, and Ad Manager Help Centers, as well as the new Help Center. Google helps to enable a free and open internet by providing the ability for publishers to monetize their content and for advertisers to reach prospective customers with useful, relevant products and services. Publisher restrictions identify content that is restricted from receiving certain sources of advertising. If your content is labeled with an inventory restriction, fewer advertising sources will be eligible to bid on it. In some cases this will mean that no advertising sources are bidding on your inventory and no ads will appear on your content. Please note that Google Ads (formerly AdWords) advertisements will not serve on content labeled with these restrictions. Therefore, while you can choose to monetize content covered by these Google Publisher Restrictions, this content will likely receive less advertising than other, nonrestricted content. Google Publisher Restrictions are organized into the following categories: Content restrictions Behavioral restrictions Video inventory restrictions These restrictions apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products. Learn more about the commonly used policy terms and what they mean in the glossary. Content restrictions Sexual content Is content that: contains nudity. is sexually gratifying, sexually suggestive and/or intended to cause sexual arousal.

        "content": "Google Publisher Restrictions We are in the process of migrating and consolidating all of the Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions to the new Publisher Policies Help Center. For now, you can still view all the policies in the AdMob, AdSense, and Ad Manager Help Centers, as well as the new Help Center. Google helps to enable a free and open internet by providing the ability for publishers to monetize their content and for advertisers to reach prospective customers with useful, relevant products and services. Publisher restrictions identify content that is restricted from receiving certain sources of advertising. If your content is labeled with an inventory restriction, fewer advertising sources will be eligible to bid on it. In some cases this will mean that no advertising sources are bidding on your inventory and no ads will appear on your content. Please note that Google Ads (formerly AdWords) advertisements will not serve on content labeled with these restrictions. Therefore, while you can choose to monetize content covered by these Google Publisher Restrictions, this content will likely receive less advertising than other, nonrestricted content. Google Publisher Restrictions are organized into the following categories: Content restrictions Behavioral restrictions Video inventory restrictions These restrictions apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products.

Publishers are required to keep abreast of changes to policies and be in compliance with them at all times. Update to US Office of Foreign Asset Control Sanctions List (August 2025) In August 2025, the Google Publisher Policies page will be updated to reflect the removal of Syria from the US Office of Foreign Asset Control sanctions list. (Posted August 2025) Update to Google Publisher Policies for Dishonest declarations (July, 2025) In July 2025, Google will update the examples of the Google Publisher Policy for Dishonest declarations to provide clearer guidance to publishers. This is not a change to the existing policy or enforcement, only a clarification. (Posted July 2025) Update to Google Publisher Restrictions for Online Gambling (March 2025) In March 2025, Google will update the Google Publisher Restriction for Online Gambling such that the restriction will apply when online gambling content is shown to users located outside of the allowed countries. The allowed countries are Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Philippines, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. (Posted February 2025) Update to Google Publisher Policies to unify with existing disclosures policies (February 2025) On 16 February 2025, Google removed the clause about disclosure from this policy to unify it with the privacy disclosures policy. Google will also remove the clause about data use to align with the prohibited activities clause in our platforms policies. (Posted February 2025) Update to Regional Monetization Pause Policies (January 29, 2025) To streamline our policies and provide clearer guidance to publishers, we are moving all policies related to monetization pauses in specific regions to a new page titled \"Regional Monetization Pause Policies\". This page will include the existing policies related to developments in Russia and the military conflict in Ukraine. This change will take effect immediately. Read the Regional Monetization Pause Policies. (Posted January 2025) Update to the Google Publisher Policies (February 2025) The publisher policies will change on February 16, 2025. The changes reflect advances in privacy-enhancing technologies (such as on-device processing, Trusted Execution Environments, and secure multi-party computation) and the broader range of surfaces on which ads are served (such as Connected TVs and gaming consoles). They also maintain the obligation on partners to provide transparency to users. Learn more about this change (Posted on December 18, 2024) Moving the Policies for video inventory to the Google Publisher Restrictions (September 2024) On 23 September 2024, Google will move the existing Policies for video inventory from the Google Publisher Policies to the Google Publisher Restrictions as Video inventory restrictions. Video inventory that contains content restricted in the Video inventory restrictions may receive less advertising than other, non-restricted content. Please note that Google Ads and non-direct Ad Manager transactions (i.e., private auction and open auction) will continue not to serve on any video inventory containing content restricted in the Video inventory restrictions, but such inventory may receive ads from other advertising products or via the use of direct Ad Manager deals between publishers and advertisers (i.e., traditional reservations, preferred deals and programmatic guaranteed). In addition, we will also make editorial updates to the following sections of the Video inventory restrictions for better clarity and readability. These editorial updates do not change the scope of the requirements. Video inventory controls (for example, play, pause, mute, skip, or dismiss), and ad content or controls where provided, must not be obstructed, hidden, or non-functional. For clarity, video inventory controls or ad controls that are activated or displayed only as a result of a single user action (for example, scrolling, hovering over, tapping or swiping the screen) are not considered as obstructed, hidden, or non-functional. For In-stream or Accompanying Content placements that transition to a sticky placement, the video player must start in the main content and only transition as a user scrolls the video player off the page. (Posted August 2024) Update to monetization in Russia (August 2024) Due to ongoing developments in Russia, we are pausing the ability of Russia-based publishers to monetize with AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager. (Posted August 2024) Update to Google Publisher Policies for Personalized advertising (August 2024) In August 2024, Google will create a Google Publisher Policy for \"Personalized advertising\". All publishers must follow the rules about personalized ads serving in order to protect user privacy and prevent discriminatory practices. The creation of this policy as a Publisher Policy is simply to provide a consistent policy experience for all publishers. (Posted July 2024) Update to Google Publisher Policies for Sexually Explicit Content and Spam Policies (May 2024) In May 2024, Google will update the Sexually Explicit Content policy to address synthetic sexually explicit content. The policy will be updated to specify that we do not allow promoting the creation or distribution of content that has been synthetically altered or generated to be sexually explicit or contain nudity. In addition to the above, we will also make an editorial update to clarify that Google-served ads must not be placed on screens that violate the Spam policies for Google web search. This editorial update does not change the scope of the policies. (Posted May 2024) Updating the Video publisher policy to become a Google Publisher Policy (April 2024) On 1 April 2024 Google will update the Video publisher policy, currently applicable to AdSense and Ad Manager, to apply to all video inventory including AdMob, under the Google Publisher Policies. This expansion of coverage is intended to streamline the policies across Google products, as well as to keep pace with current industry standards (e.g., IAB OpenRTB). For more details about the reasons behind the new video publisher policies and an outline of the key changes, visit Updates to video publisher policy in 2024. The updated Policies will apply to AdSense, Ad Manager and AdMob video inventory monetized with Google ad code (\"Video Inventory\"), and are as follows: Accurately describe inventory Video Inventory must provide declarations with accurate signals (for Ad Manager, see VAST ad tag URL parameters), including: Audibility of ad placement: Audible by default or muted (for Ad Manager, see vpmute parameter). Type of ad placement: Video ads serving into video players with video content must be accurately declared as either \"In-stream\" or \"Accompanying Content\" placements (for Ad Manager, see plcmt parameter). Video ads serving into non-video player placements do not require declarations, and will be automatically determined by Google based on inventory format as either \"Interstitial\" or \"Standalone\" placements. \"In-stream\" means a video or audio ad played within the stream of video or audio content, where the video or audio content is the focus of the user's visit or explicitly requested by the user. Example: A video ad that is played before, in the middle of, or after the stream of a user-requested video content. \"Accompanying Content\" means a video ad played within the stream of video content accompanying the main content of the user’s visit, where the video content is neither the focus of the user’s visit nor explicitly requested by the user. Accompanying Content placements must load within the body of the page, and muted by default. Example: A video ad that is played before, in the middle of, or after the stream of muted video content that takes up a small portion of a primarily editorial page. \"Interstitial\" means a video ad played without the presence of any other streaming video content in a transition between content, where the video ad is the primary focus of the page and takes up the majority of the viewport. Example: A video ad that is independent of any other streaming video content, and that is placed in full view in a natural break or transition between content. \"Standalone\" means a video ad played without the presence of any other streaming video content, where the video ad is not the focus of the page. Example: A video ad that is independent of any other streaming video content, and that is placed in a banner at the right rail of an article page. Use supported implementations In-stream or Accompanying Content placements must use the Google Interactive Media Ads SDK or Google Programmatic Access Library on supported platforms, unless through an official Google Beta program. Partners and publishers cannot use Interactive Media Ads products to monetize YouTube content. For YouTube content, partners and publishers must monetize through the YouTube Partner Program. Interstitial or Standalone placements must use Google-provided solutions: on web: Google Publisher Tags; in app: the Google Mobile Ads SDK (for Ad Manager; for AdMob). The Google Interactive Media Ads SDK is not allowed for Interstitial or Standalone placements, except for placements in games. Protect advertiser value Video Inventory content or controls (for example, play, pause, mute, skip, or dismiss), including ad content or controls where provided, must not be obstructed, hidden, or non-functional. For In-stream placements, audio ads must not be requested or served in muted placements. Respect the user Video Inventory may autoplay, provided that: Only one Video Inventory across all placement types may autoplay with sound at any time. Additionally for In-stream or Accompanying Content placements, only one video player may autoplay in view at any time. The ad must not autoplay until at least 50% of the ad unit is visible. Video Inventory may be sticky, provided that: A dismiss option is presented for the entire duration of the video or ad content. This option must not be hidden, obstructed, or non-functional. For In-stream or Accompanying Content placements, the video player must start in the main content and only transition to a sticky placement as a user scrolls the video player off the page. Additionally for Ad Manager, the terms \"instream\" or \"in-stream\" in Help Center pages and in-product controls refer to both \"In-stream\" and \"Accompanying Content\" as defined in the updated Policies. Ad Manager Video Inventory that are \"In-stream\" or \"Accompanying Content\" per the updated Policies must adhere to the respective requirements in the Policies. The updated Policies will take effect on 1 April 2024. Please review the updated Policies to determine if it affects your Video Inventory. If your Video Inventory was previously disapproved but you believe they should no longer be disapproved following the update, you may request a review or appeal on or after 1 April 2024.

Please review the update to determine if it affects your site or app. If your site or app received restricted ad serving previously due to Shocking content but you believe ad serving should no longer be restricted following the update, you may request a review or appeal of your site or app on or after 30 August 2023.

The Google Ad Manager Partner Guidelines will be updated to clarify Google has no liability arising from or related to Parent or Child (i) undergoing a change of control event or (ii) assigning any networks, inventory, or contract(s) for the Google Ad Manager services to a third party. In recent months, Google has also made the following two updates to the Google Publisher Policies: The AdSense Program policies and AdMob Program policies have been updated to include information about the new WebView API for ads which enables proper support of web display ads in apps. The Webmaster Guidelines have been replaced with the Spam policies for Google web search. As a result, references to the Webmaster Guidelines have been updated. Publishers should review the Spam policies for Google web search. (Posted December 2022) Update regarding Ukraine (March 2022) Due to the war in Ukraine, we will pause monetization of content that exploits, dismisses, or condones the war. (Posted March 23, 2022) Update to Russian Federation State-Funded Media Monetization (February 2022) In light of the war in Ukraine, we are pausing Google’s monetization of Russian Federation state-funded media.

This addition is effective immediately. The country restriction pages for AdMob, AdSense, and Ad Manager have also been updated to reflect this change. (Posted February 2022) Update to Misrepresentative content policy for Unreliable and harmful claims (October 2021) In November 2021, the Google Publisher Policy for Misrepresentative content: Unreliable and harmful claims will be updated to include a new policy prohibiting content that promotes claims about climate change that run contrary to authoritative scientific consensus. We will begin enforcing the policy update after November 8, 2021. (Posted October 2021) Simplifying and standardizing our policies (September 2021) As part of continuing efforts to simplify and streamline our policies for publishers and in conjunction with our September 2021 changes for behavioral policies, we’re launching a new Publisher Policies Help Center. This new Help Center will bring our publishers an easy way to access our policies and to make it easy to understand how they affect you, no matter which products you use. You will still be able to view Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions on the AdMob, AdSense, and Ad Manager Help Centers. Over time, we will be migrating and consolidating the Publisher policies and restrictions into the new Publisher Policies Help Center. In addition to the policies and restrictions, the Publisher Policies Help Center includes a glossary defining the most common terms used in policy language and special pages for each policy and restriction with additional explanatory material to help clarify the policy language. (Posted September 2021) Update to Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) (October 2021) In October 2021, the Google Publisher Policy relating to Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) will be updated due to Google implementing the European Commission's updated SCCs. (Posted September 2021) Simplifying and standardizing our behavioral policies (August 2021) In September 2021, as part of our continued efforts to simplify and streamline our policies for publishers, the Google Publisher Policies and Publisher Restrictions will be updated to include aligned versions of some of our existing behavioral policies (meaning those policies/restrictions which dictate how ads are implemented). These aligned versions consolidate versions of policies that we have had across AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager and include: Ads Interfering, Inventory Value, and Industry Standards (a collection of existing standards we require our publishers to comply with). In September 2019, we launched changes to our content policies across our publisher products that introduced the Google Publisher Policies and the Google Publisher Restrictions. This update is a continuation of that ongoing effort. As an additional part of this update, we will also launch two new policies: compliance with the Coalition for Better Ads’ Better Ads Standards and a policy for Dishonest Declarations. We want to bring our publishers an easy way to access our policies and to make it easy to understand how they affect you, no matter which products you use, which is why we are also launching a revamped version of our Policy Help Center. Please note that these policies and restrictions will apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products. (Posted August 2021) Update to Google Publisher Policies for Animal cruelty (August 2021) In August 2021, the Google Publisher Policy for Endangered or threatened species will be updated to clarify that we prohibit content that promotes cruelty or gratuitous violence towards animals. This update will consolidate the Endangered or threatened species and the Animal cruelty policy under a new Animal cruelty topic. (Posted July, 2021) Update to Google Ad Manager System Maximum and Limits (February 2020) Note: Ad Manager only update. In February 2020, the Google Ad Manager System Maximum and Limits will be updated to clarify the intended uses for specific line item types: Sponsorship line items, Standard line items, Price Priority line items, Network line items, Bulk line items and House line items. Since the introduction of Ad Manager, we’ve been working to simplify our systems to help publishers create sustainable businesses with advertising. While we have shared best practices about how each line item type should be used for many years, we are updating our System Limits and Maximums requirements to reflect the uses that each line item type has been specifically designed for. These requirements ensure that all equivalent demand sources are treated the same and that Google’s ability to make changes that benefit all publishers is maintained. Today, the vast majority of publishers use line items for their intended purposes. This change will only impact a very small number of publishers and does not impact private marketplace deals booked as Sponsorship or Standard line items. Publishers will have until May 2020 to familiarize themselves with the requirement and, for the subset that are impacted, come into compliance with the new requirement. (Posted February 2020) Update to Misrepresentative content policy (May 2021) In May 2021, the Google Publisher Policy for Misrepresentative content will be updated to better organize the topics within the policy. Additionally, two policies previously listed under Dangerous or Derogatory Content will be moved to Misrepresentative content. The two policies, which prohibit (1) content promoting harmful health claims, and (2) content that relates to a current, major health crisis and contradicts authoritative scientific consensus, will be moved from the Dangerous or Derogatory content section to the (new) Unreliable claims section of Misrepresentative content. These changes are being undertaken to improve readability and understanding and do not impact what is currently restricted or prohibited per our policies. (Posted April 2021) Update to US Office of Foreign Asset Control Sanctions List (February 2021) In February 2021, the Understanding AdSense country restrictions page will be updated to reflect the removal of Sudan from the US Office of Foreign Asset Control sanctions list.

(Posted February 2021) Update to Google Publisher Policy for Sexually explicit content (February 2021) In February 2021, the Google Publisher Policies will be updated. Content that may be interpreted as promoting a sexual act in exchange for compensation will become its own category named \"Compensated sexual acts\". Additionally, we will update the examples listed (prostitution, companionship and escort services, intimate massage, cuddling sites) to clearly prohibit promotion of compensated dating or sexual arrangements where one participant is expected to provide money, gifts, financial support, mentorship, or other valuable benefits to another participant such as \"Sugar\" dating. (Posted December 2020) Update to Rewarded inventory policy (August 2020) Note: Ad Manager and AdMob only update. In August 2020, the Rewarded inventory policy for Ad Manager and AdMob will be updated to accommodate the launch of the new, rewarded interstitial ad format. The new format will expand the types of ads that offer rewards beyond the current rewarded ad format.

(Posted July 2020) Update to Google Ad Manager Partner Guidelines: Invalid Activity (September 2020) Note: Ad Manager only update. In September 2020, Ad Manager Partner Guidelines for Invalid Activity will be updated to include limitations to how ad requests and impressions can pass through Open Bidding on app. When using Open Bidding on app, partners will not be permitted to send ad requests through intermediary solutions, including in-house systems, that dynamically or programmatically allocate and monetize ad requests based on actual, estimated, or other real-time pricing information. This policy update will be effective from and including October 21, 2020. (Posted September 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policies (September 2020) In September 2020, the Google Publisher Policies will be updated to prohibit monetization of web pages, sites or apps that are not primarily in one of our supported languages, or that do not contain content. From September 15, 2020, we will not allow new sites to be monetized using AdSense, Ad Manager or AdMob in unsupported languages or where they do not contain content. (Posted August 2020) Update to Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) (August 2020) Starting August 12, 2020, Google will rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers of online advertising and measurement personal data out of the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland. For Processor Services, Google is updating the Google Ads Data Processing Terms to include the SCCs for transfers of personal data to processors established in third countries. For Controller Services, Google is updating the Google Ads Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms to include the SCCs for transfers of personal data to controllers established in third countries. Where there is a relevant transfer of personal data, the SCCs incorporated into Partner’s contract with Google will apply. (Posted August 2020) Update to Rewarded inventory policy (August 2020) Note: Ad Manager and AdMob only update. In August 2020, the Rewarded inventory policy for Ad Manager and AdMob will be updated to accommodate the launch of the new, rewarded interstitial ad format.

We will begin enforcing this policy on September 1, 2020 in the United States and on October 1, 2020 in all other countries. We take violations of this policy very seriously and consider them egregious. If we find violations of this policy, we will suspend your accounts upon detection and without prior warning. (Posted July 2020) Update to Dangerous or derogatory content (August 2020) In August 2020, the Google Publisher Policies for Dangerous or derogatory content will be updated to prohibit content that relates to a current, major health crisis and contradicts authoritative, scientific consensus. (Posted July 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policy for Enabling Dishonest Behavior (August 2020) In August 2020, the Google Publisher Policies for Enabling Dishonest Behavior will be updated to clarify restrictions on advertising or monetizing content that promotes spyware and surveillance technology. The updated policy will prohibit the promotion or monetization of content that enables a user, or promotes products and services that enable a user, to track or monitor another person or their activities without their authorization. This policy will apply globally. Examples of products and services that will be prohibited (non-exhaustive) Spyware and technology used for intimate partner surveillance including but not limited to spyware/malware that can be used to monitor texts, phone calls, or browsing history; GPS trackers specifically marketed to spy or track someone without their consent; promotion of surveillance equipment (cameras, audio recorders, dash cams, nanny cams) marketed with the express purpose of spying.

(Posted July 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policies (August 2020) In August 2020, the Google Publisher Policies will be updated to standardize the existing policies across our publisher products pertaining to child sexual abuse and exploitation.

(Posted July 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policy for Misrepresentative content (March 2020) In March 2020, the Google Publisher Policy for Misrepresentative content will be updated. The update is to clarify that we do not allow content that makes claims that are demonstrably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process.

(Posted February 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policies (April 2020) In April 2020, the Google Publisher Policies will be updated to standardize the existing policies across our publisher products pertaining to personally identifiable information, data collection, disclosure and user consent. As part of this, we will update our policy to require more explicit forms of notice before users grant permission to share device location for advertising purposes. (Posted February 2020) Update to Google Ad Manager System Maximum and Limits (February 2020) Note: Ad Manager only update. In February 2020, the Google Ad Manager System Maximum and Limits will be updated to clarify the intended uses for specific line item types: Sponsorship line items, Standard line items, Price Priority line items, Network line items, Bulk line items and House line items. Since the introduction of Ad Manager, we’ve been working to simplify our systems to help publishers create sustainable businesses with advertising. While we have shared best practices about how each line item type should be used for many years, we are updating our System Limits and Maximums requirements to reflect the uses that each line item type has been specifically designed for. These requirements ensure that all equivalent demand sources are treated the same and that Google’s ability to make changes that benefit all publishers is maintained. Today, the vast majority of publishers use line items for their intended purposes. This change will only impact a very small number of publishers and does not impact private marketplace deals booked as Sponsorship or Standard line items. Publishers will have until May 2020 to familiarize themselves with the requirement and, for the subset that are impacted, come into compliance with the new requirement.

It will include content made by or in support of transnational drug trafficking organizations. (Posted November 2019) Simplifying and standardizing our content policies (September 2019) In September 2019, we’re launching changes to some of our content policies across our publisher products (AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager). Please note that going forward, Google will be announcing updates to our policies and restrictions for AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager on this change log. Publishers are required to keep abreast of changes to policies and be in compliance with them at all times. Why we’re making these changes One of the top requests we hear from publishers is that they want us to simplify and streamline our policies. We know that many of you use several of our publisher products and we want to bring you a clear and easy way to understand how to interact with our policies and how they affect you, no matter which products you use. Here’s what you can expect: Google Publisher Policies, which outline the types of content we won’t monetize through any of our publisher products. These include: Illegal Content, Child Sexual Abuse Material & Pedophilia, Sexually Explicit Content, Adult Themes in Family Content, Intellectual Property Abuse, Endangered or Threatened Species, Dangerous or Derogatory Content, Enabling Dishonest Behavior, Misrepresentative Content, Malicious or Unwanted Software, and Mail Order Brides​. Google Publisher Restrictions, which outline the types of content which will receive restricted sources of advertising. These include: Sexual Content, Shocking Content, Explosives, Guns, Gun Parts & Related Products, Other Weapons, Tobacco, Recreational Drugs, Alcohol Sales and Misuse, Online Gambling, Prescription Drugs, and Unapproved Pharmaceuticals and Supplements. Google Ads (formerly AdWords) will continue not to serve on any of this restricted content; it will only receive ads from other advertising products or via the use of direct deals between publishers and advertisers. Alignment across our publisher products, bringing simplicity, consistency, and ease of understanding, regardless of the product(s) you choose to use. What it means for you as an AdSense, AdMob, or Ad Manager publisher Monetizing content that falls under the Google Publisher Restrictions will no longer be a policy violation; instead, we will restrict advertising on that content as appropriate, based on the preferences of each advertising product and/or advertisers’ individual preferences. In some cases this will mean that no advertising sources are bidding on your inventory and no ads will appear on this restricted content. So while you can choose to monetize content covered by the Google Publisher Restrictions, doing so will mean you will likely receive less advertising on this restricted content than you would receive on other, nonrestricted content. Content that falls under the Google Publisher Policies is not allowed to be monetized and you should not place ads against that content. Attempting to monetize policy-violating content may result in your account(s) being suspended or terminated. Please note that these policies and restrictions will apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products. What you need to do Nothing at this time. The Help Center and Policy Center will be updated in September 2019 when this takes effect with the full breakdown of policies and restrictions. At that time, please review the updated policies and restrictions and ensure that your content is in compliance.

Read the Regional Monetization Pause Policies. (Posted January 2025) Update to the Google Publisher Policies (February 2025) The publisher policies will change on February 16, 2025. The changes reflect advances in privacy-enhancing technologies (such as on-device processing, Trusted Execution Environments, and secure multi-party computation) and the broader range of surfaces on which ads are served (such as Connected TVs and gaming consoles). They also maintain the obligation on partners to provide transparency to users. Learn more about this change (Posted on December 18, 2024) Moving the Policies for video inventory to the Google Publisher Restrictions (September 2024) On 23 September 2024, Google will move the existing Policies for video inventory from the Google Publisher Policies to the Google Publisher Restrictions as Video inventory restrictions. Video inventory that contains content restricted in the Video inventory restrictions may receive less advertising than other, non-restricted content. Please note that Google Ads and non-direct Ad Manager transactions (i.e., private auction and open auction) will continue not to serve on any video inventory containing content restricted in the Video inventory restrictions, but such inventory may receive ads from other advertising products or via the use of direct Ad Manager deals between publishers and advertisers (i.e., traditional reservations, preferred deals and programmatic guaranteed). In addition, we will also make editorial updates to the following sections of the Video inventory restrictions for better clarity and readability. These editorial updates do not change the scope of the requirements. Video inventory controls (for example, play, pause, mute, skip, or dismiss), and ad content or controls where provided, must not be obstructed, hidden, or non-functional. For clarity, video inventory controls or ad controls that are activated or displayed only as a result of a single user action (for example, scrolling, hovering over, tapping or swiping the screen) are not considered as obstructed, hidden, or non-functional. For In-stream or Accompanying Content placements that transition to a sticky placement, the video player must start in the main content and only transition as a user scrolls the video player off the page. (Posted August 2024) Update to monetization in Russia (August 2024) Due to ongoing developments in Russia, we are pausing the ability of Russia-based publishers to monetize with AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager. (Posted August 2024) Update to Google Publisher Policies for Personalized advertising (August 2024) In August 2024, Google will create a Google Publisher Policy for \"Personalized advertising\". All publishers must follow the rules about personalized ads serving in order to protect user privacy and prevent discriminatory practices. The creation of this policy as a Publisher Policy is simply to provide a consistent policy experience for all publishers. (Posted July 2024) Update to Google Publisher Policies for Sexually Explicit Content and Spam Policies (May 2024) In May 2024, Google will update the Sexually Explicit Content policy to address synthetic sexually explicit content. The policy will be updated to specify that we do not allow promoting the creation or distribution of content that has been synthetically altered or generated to be sexually explicit or contain nudity. In addition to the above, we will also make an editorial update to clarify that Google-served ads must not be placed on screens that violate the Spam policies for Google web search. This editorial update does not change the scope of the policies. (Posted May 2024) Updating the Video publisher policy to become a Google Publisher Policy (April 2024) On 1 April 2024 Google will update the Video publisher policy, currently applicable to AdSense and Ad Manager, to apply to all video inventory including AdMob, under the Google Publisher Policies. This expansion of coverage is intended to streamline the policies across Google products, as well as to keep pace with current industry standards (e.g., IAB OpenRTB). For more details about the reasons behind the new video publisher policies and an outline of the key changes, visit Updates to video publisher policy in 2024. The updated Policies will apply to AdSense, Ad Manager and AdMob video inventory monetized with Google ad code (\"Video Inventory\"), and are as follows: Accurately describe inventory Video Inventory must provide declarations with accurate signals (for Ad Manager, see VAST ad tag URL parameters), including: Audibility of ad placement: Audible by default or muted (for Ad Manager, see vpmute parameter). Type of ad placement: Video ads serving into video players with video content must be accurately declared as either \"In-stream\" or \"Accompanying Content\" placements (for Ad Manager, see plcmt parameter). Video ads serving into non-video player placements do not require declarations, and will be automatically determined by Google based on inventory format as either \"Interstitial\" or \"Standalone\" placements. \"In-stream\" means a video or audio ad played within the stream of video or audio content, where the video or audio content is the focus of the user's visit or explicitly requested by the user. Example: A video ad that is played before, in the middle of, or after the stream of a user-requested video content. \"Accompanying Content\" means a video ad played within the stream of video content accompanying the main content of the user’s visit, where the video content is neither the focus of the user’s visit nor explicitly requested by the user. Accompanying Content placements must load within the body of the page, and muted by default. Example: A video ad that is played before, in the middle of, or after the stream of muted video content that takes up a small portion of a primarily editorial page. \"Interstitial\" means a video ad played without the presence of any other streaming video content in a transition between content, where the video ad is the primary focus of the page and takes up the majority of the viewport. Example: A video ad that is independent of any other streaming video content, and that is placed in full view in a natural break or transition between content. \"Standalone\" means a video ad played without the presence of any other streaming video content, where the video ad is not the focus of the page. Example: A video ad that is independent of any other streaming video content, and that is placed in a banner at the right rail of an article page. Use supported implementations In-stream or Accompanying Content placements must use the Google Interactive Media Ads SDK or Google Programmatic Access Library on supported platforms, unless through an official Google Beta program. Partners and publishers cannot use Interactive Media Ads products to monetize YouTube content. For YouTube content, partners and publishers must monetize through the YouTube Partner Program. Interstitial or Standalone placements must use Google-provided solutions: on web: Google Publisher Tags; in app: the Google Mobile Ads SDK (for Ad Manager; for AdMob). The Google Interactive Media Ads SDK is not allowed for Interstitial or Standalone placements, except for placements in games. Protect advertiser value Video Inventory content or controls (for example, play, pause, mute, skip, or dismiss), including ad content or controls where provided, must not be obstructed, hidden, or non-functional. For In-stream placements, audio ads must not be requested or served in muted placements. Respect the user Video Inventory may autoplay, provided that: Only one Video Inventory across all placement types may autoplay with sound at any time. Additionally for In-stream or Accompanying Content placements, only one video player may autoplay in view at any time. The ad must not autoplay until at least 50% of the ad unit is visible. Video Inventory may be sticky, provided that: A dismiss option is presented for the entire duration of the video or ad content. This option must not be hidden, obstructed, or non-functional. For In-stream or Accompanying Content placements, the video player must start in the main content and only transition to a sticky placement as a user scrolls the video player off the page. Additionally for Ad Manager, the terms \"instream\" or \"in-stream\" in Help Center pages and in-product controls refer to both \"In-stream\" and \"Accompanying Content\" as defined in the updated Policies. Ad Manager Video Inventory that are \"In-stream\" or \"Accompanying Content\" per the updated Policies must adhere to the respective requirements in the Policies. The updated Policies will take effect on 1 April 2024. Please review the updated Policies to determine if it affects your Video Inventory. If your Video Inventory was previously disapproved but you believe they should no longer be disapproved following the update, you may request a review or appeal on or after 1 April 2024.

In the context of gameplay imagery, content is only considered to \"contain gruesome, graphic, or disgusting accounts or imagery\" or \"depict acts of violence\" if it depicts acts of torture, sexual violence, violence against minors, violence against prominent real-name persons, or violence against an individual or group on the basis of a characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization. Please review the update to determine if it affects your site or app. If your site or app received restricted ad serving previously due to Shocking content but you believe ad serving should no longer be restricted following the update, you may request a review or appeal of your site or app on or after 30 August 2023. More information on requesting a review or appeal can be found below: For AdSense: Request a review For AdMob: AdMob policy violation: Disabled app(s) or account For Ad Manager: Request a review (Posted July 2023) Google Publisher Policies (January 2023) In January 2023, Google will make the following updates to the Google Publisher Policies: We are bringing our existing Malware and Unwanted software policy into the Google Publisher Policies: Requirements and other standards as part of our continued efforts to simplify and streamline our policies. The Google Ad Manager Partner Guidelines will be updated to clarify Google has no liability arising from or related to Parent or Child (i) undergoing a change of control event or (ii) assigning any networks, inventory, or contract(s) for the Google Ad Manager services to a third party. In recent months, Google has also made the following two updates to the Google Publisher Policies: The AdSense Program policies and AdMob Program policies have been updated to include information about the new WebView API for ads which enables proper support of web display ads in apps. The Webmaster Guidelines have been replaced with the Spam policies for Google web search. As a result, references to the Webmaster Guidelines have been updated. Publishers should review the Spam policies for Google web search. (Posted December 2022) Update regarding Ukraine (March 2022) Due to the war in Ukraine, we will pause monetization of content that exploits, dismisses, or condones the war. (Posted March 23, 2022) Update to Russian Federation State-Funded Media Monetization (February 2022) In light of the war in Ukraine, we are pausing Google’s monetization of Russian Federation state-funded media. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary. This is effective immediately. (Posted February 2022) Update to US Office of Foreign Asset Control Sanctions List (February 2022) The Google Publisher Policies Sanctions compliance list has been updated to reflect the addition of the so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LNR) in order to comply with the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This addition is effective immediately. The country restriction pages for AdMob, AdSense, and Ad Manager have also been updated to reflect this change. (Posted February 2022) Update to Misrepresentative content policy for Unreliable and harmful claims (October 2021) In November 2021, the Google Publisher Policy for Misrepresentative content: Unreliable and harmful claims will be updated to include a new policy prohibiting content that promotes claims about climate change that run contrary to authoritative scientific consensus. We will begin enforcing the policy update after November 8, 2021. (Posted October 2021) Simplifying and standardizing our policies (September 2021) As part of continuing efforts to simplify and streamline our policies for publishers and in conjunction with our September 2021 changes for behavioral policies, we’re launching a new Publisher Policies Help Center. This new Help Center will bring our publishers an easy way to access our policies and to make it easy to understand how they affect you, no matter which products you use. You will still be able to view Google Publisher Policies and Google Publisher Restrictions on the AdMob, AdSense, and Ad Manager Help Centers. Over time, we will be migrating and consolidating the Publisher policies and restrictions into the new Publisher Policies Help Center. In addition to the policies and restrictions, the Publisher Policies Help Center includes a glossary defining the most common terms used in policy language and special pages for each policy and restriction with additional explanatory material to help clarify the policy language. (Posted September 2021) Update to Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) (October 2021) In October 2021, the Google Publisher Policy relating to Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) will be updated due to Google implementing the European Commission's updated SCCs. (Posted September 2021) Simplifying and standardizing our behavioral policies (August 2021) In September 2021, as part of our continued efforts to simplify and streamline our policies for publishers, the Google Publisher Policies and Publisher Restrictions will be updated to include aligned versions of some of our existing behavioral policies (meaning those policies/restrictions which dictate how ads are implemented). These aligned versions consolidate versions of policies that we have had across AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager and include: Ads Interfering, Inventory Value, and Industry Standards (a collection of existing standards we require our publishers to comply with). In September 2019, we launched changes to our content policies across our publisher products that introduced the Google Publisher Policies and the Google Publisher Restrictions. This update is a continuation of that ongoing effort. As an additional part of this update, we will also launch two new policies: compliance with the Coalition for Better Ads’ Better Ads Standards and a policy for Dishonest Declarations. We want to bring our publishers an easy way to access our policies and to make it easy to understand how they affect you, no matter which products you use, which is why we are also launching a revamped version of our Policy Help Center. Please note that these policies and restrictions will apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products. (Posted August 2021) Update to Google Publisher Policies for Animal cruelty (August 2021) In August 2021, the Google Publisher Policy for Endangered or threatened species will be updated to clarify that we prohibit content that promotes cruelty or gratuitous violence towards animals. This update will consolidate the Endangered or threatened species and the Animal cruelty policy under a new Animal cruelty topic. (Posted July, 2021) Update to Google Ad Manager System Maximum and Limits (February 2020) Note: Ad Manager only update. In February 2020, the Google Ad Manager System Maximum and Limits will be updated to clarify the intended uses for specific line item types: Sponsorship line items, Standard line items, Price Priority line items, Network line items, Bulk line items and House line items. Since the introduction of Ad Manager, we’ve been working to simplify our systems to help publishers create sustainable businesses with advertising. While we have shared best practices about how each line item type should be used for many years, we are updating our System Limits and Maximums requirements to reflect the uses that each line item type has been specifically designed for. These requirements ensure that all equivalent demand sources are treated the same and that Google’s ability to make changes that benefit all publishers is maintained. Today, the vast majority of publishers use line items for their intended purposes. This change will only impact a very small number of publishers and does not impact private marketplace deals booked as Sponsorship or Standard line items. Publishers will have until May 2020 to familiarize themselves with the requirement and, for the subset that are impacted, come into compliance with the new requirement. (Posted February 2020) Update to Misrepresentative content policy (May 2021) In May 2021, the Google Publisher Policy for Misrepresentative content will be updated to better organize the topics within the policy. Additionally, two policies previously listed under Dangerous or Derogatory Content will be moved to Misrepresentative content. The two policies, which prohibit (1) content promoting harmful health claims, and (2) content that relates to a current, major health crisis and contradicts authoritative scientific consensus, will be moved from the Dangerous or Derogatory content section to the (new) Unreliable claims section of Misrepresentative content. These changes are being undertaken to improve readability and understanding and do not impact what is currently restricted or prohibited per our policies. (Posted April 2021) Update to US Office of Foreign Asset Control Sanctions List (February 2021) In February 2021, the Understanding AdSense country restrictions page will be updated to reflect the removal of Sudan from the US Office of Foreign Asset Control sanctions list. This update will take effect on February 24, 2021. Due to this change, Google AdSense will be available for publishers in Sudan. (Posted February 2021) Update to Google Publisher Policy for Sexually explicit content (February 2021) In February 2021, the Google Publisher Policies will be updated. Content that may be interpreted as promoting a sexual act in exchange for compensation will become its own category named \"Compensated sexual acts\". Additionally, we will update the examples listed (prostitution, companionship and escort services, intimate massage, cuddling sites) to clearly prohibit promotion of compensated dating or sexual arrangements where one participant is expected to provide money, gifts, financial support, mentorship, or other valuable benefits to another participant such as \"Sugar\" dating. (Posted December 2020) Update to Rewarded inventory policy (August 2020) Note: Ad Manager and AdMob only update. In August 2020, the Rewarded inventory policy for Ad Manager and AdMob will be updated to accommodate the launch of the new, rewarded interstitial ad format. The new format will expand the types of ads that offer rewards beyond the current rewarded ad format. With this format launch, we will rename the Rewarded inventory policy to “Policies for ads that offer rewards.” The new policy will cover both formats: rewarded ads and rewarded interstitial ads. (Posted July 2020) Update to Google Ad Manager Partner Guidelines: Invalid Activity (September 2020) Note: Ad Manager only update. In September 2020, Ad Manager Partner Guidelines for Invalid Activity will be updated to include limitations to how ad requests and impressions can pass through Open Bidding on app. When using Open Bidding on app, partners will not be permitted to send ad requests through intermediary solutions, including in-house systems, that dynamically or programmatically allocate and monetize ad requests based on actual, estimated, or other real-time pricing information. This policy update will be effective from and including October 21, 2020. (Posted September 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policies (September 2020) In September 2020, the Google Publisher Policies will be updated to prohibit monetization of web pages, sites or apps that are not primarily in one of our supported languages, or that do not contain content. From September 15, 2020, we will not allow new sites to be monetized using AdSense, Ad Manager or AdMob in unsupported languages or where they do not contain content. (Posted August 2020) Update to Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) (August 2020) Starting August 12, 2020, Google will rely on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for transfers of online advertising and measurement personal data out of the European Economic Area, the UK, or Switzerland. For Processor Services, Google is updating the Google Ads Data Processing Terms to include the SCCs for transfers of personal data to processors established in third countries. For Controller Services, Google is updating the Google Ads Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms to include the SCCs for transfers of personal data to controllers established in third countries. Where there is a relevant transfer of personal data, the SCCs incorporated into Partner’s contract with Google will apply. (Posted August 2020) Update to Rewarded inventory policy (August 2020) Note: Ad Manager and AdMob only update. In August 2020, the Rewarded inventory policy for Ad Manager and AdMob will be updated to accommodate the launch of the new, rewarded interstitial ad format. The new format will expand the types of ads that offer rewards beyond the current rewarded ad format. With this format launch, we will rename the Rewarded inventory policy to “Policies for ads that offer rewards.” The new policy will cover both formats: rewarded ads and rewarded interstitial ads. (Posted July 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policies for Misrepresentative content (September 2020) In September 2020, the Google Publisher Policies for Misrepresentative content will be updated to prohibit coordinating with other sites or accounts and concealing or misrepresenting your identity or other material details about yourself, where your content relates to politics, social issues, or matters of public concern. We will begin enforcing this policy on September 1, 2020 in the United States and on October 1, 2020 in all other countries. We take violations of this policy very seriously and consider them egregious. If we find violations of this policy, we will suspend your accounts upon detection and without prior warning. (Posted July 2020) Update to Dangerous or derogatory content (August 2020) In August 2020, the Google Publisher Policies for Dangerous or derogatory content will be updated to prohibit content that relates to a current, major health crisis and contradicts authoritative, scientific consensus. (Posted July 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policy for Enabling Dishonest Behavior (August 2020) In August 2020, the Google Publisher Policies for Enabling Dishonest Behavior will be updated to clarify restrictions on advertising or monetizing content that promotes spyware and surveillance technology. The updated policy will prohibit the promotion or monetization of content that enables a user, or promotes products and services that enable a user, to track or monitor another person or their activities without their authorization. This policy will apply globally. Examples of products and services that will be prohibited (non-exhaustive) Spyware and technology used for intimate partner surveillance including but not limited to spyware/malware that can be used to monitor texts, phone calls, or browsing history; GPS trackers specifically marketed to spy or track someone without their consent; promotion of surveillance equipment (cameras, audio recorders, dash cams, nanny cams) marketed with the express purpose of spying. This does not include (a) private investigation services or (b) products or services designed for parents to track or monitor their underage children. (Posted July 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policies (August 2020) In August 2020, the Google Publisher Policies will be updated to standardize the existing policies across our publisher products pertaining to child sexual abuse and exploitation. In addition, we will also be making some editorial changes to our policy language.

(Posted July 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policy for Misrepresentative content (March 2020) In March 2020, the Google Publisher Policy for Misrepresentative content will be updated. The update is to clarify that we do not allow content that makes claims that are demonstrably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process. Additionally, the update will also make clear that we do not allow content that deceives users through manipulated media related to politics, social issues, or matters of public concern. (Posted February 2020) Update to Google Publisher Policies (April 2020) In April 2020, the Google Publisher Policies will be updated to standardize the existing policies across our publisher products pertaining to personally identifiable information, data collection, disclosure and user consent. As part of this, we will update our policy to require more explicit forms of notice before users grant permission to share device location for advertising purposes. (Posted February 2020) Update to Google Ad Manager System Maximum and Limits (February 2020) Note: Ad Manager only update. In February 2020, the Google Ad Manager System Maximum and Limits will be updated to clarify the intended uses for specific line item types: Sponsorship line items, Standard line items, Price Priority line items, Network line items, Bulk line items and House line items. Since the introduction of Ad Manager, we’ve been working to simplify our systems to help publishers create sustainable businesses with advertising. While we have shared best practices about how each line item type should be used for many years, we are updating our System Limits and Maximums requirements to reflect the uses that each line item type has been specifically designed for. These requirements ensure that all equivalent demand sources are treated the same and that Google’s ability to make changes that benefit all publishers is maintained. Today, the vast majority of publishers use line items for their intended purposes. This change will only impact a very small number of publishers and does not impact private marketplace deals booked as Sponsorship or Standard line items. Publishers will have until May 2020 to familiarize themselves with the requirement and, for the subset that are impacted, come into compliance with the new requirement.

It will include content made by or in support of transnational drug trafficking organizations. (Posted November 2019) Simplifying and standardizing our content policies (September 2019) In September 2019, we’re launching changes to some of our content policies across our publisher products (AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager). Please note that going forward, Google will be announcing updates to our policies and restrictions for AdSense, AdMob, and Ad Manager on this change log. Publishers are required to keep abreast of changes to policies and be in compliance with them at all times. Why we’re making these changes One of the top requests we hear from publishers is that they want us to simplify and streamline our policies. We know that many of you use several of our publisher products and we want to bring you a clear and easy way to understand how to interact with our policies and how they affect you, no matter which products you use. Here’s what you can expect: Google Publisher Policies, which outline the types of content we won’t monetize through any of our publisher products. These include: Illegal Content, Child Sexual Abuse Material & Pedophilia, Sexually Explicit Content, Adult Themes in Family Content, Intellectual Property Abuse, Endangered or Threatened Species, Dangerous or Derogatory Content, Enabling Dishonest Behavior, Misrepresentative Content, Malicious or Unwanted Software, and Mail Order Brides​. Google Publisher Restrictions, which outline the types of content which will receive restricted sources of advertising. These include: Sexual Content, Shocking Content, Explosives, Guns, Gun Parts & Related Products, Other Weapons, Tobacco, Recreational Drugs, Alcohol Sales and Misuse, Online Gambling, Prescription Drugs, and Unapproved Pharmaceuticals and Supplements. Google Ads (formerly AdWords) will continue not to serve on any of this restricted content; it will only receive ads from other advertising products or via the use of direct deals between publishers and advertisers. Alignment across our publisher products, bringing simplicity, consistency, and ease of understanding, regardless of the product(s) you choose to use. What it means for you as an AdSense, AdMob, or Ad Manager publisher Monetizing content that falls under the Google Publisher Restrictions will no longer be a policy violation; instead, we will restrict advertising on that content as appropriate, based on the preferences of each advertising product and/or advertisers’ individual preferences. In some cases this will mean that no advertising sources are bidding on your inventory and no ads will appear on this restricted content. So while you can choose to monetize content covered by the Google Publisher Restrictions, doing so will mean you will likely receive less advertising on this restricted content than you would receive on other, nonrestricted content. Content that falls under the Google Publisher Policies is not allowed to be monetized and you should not place ads against that content. Attempting to monetize policy-violating content may result in your account(s) being suspended or terminated. Please note that these policies and restrictions will apply in addition to any other policies governing your use of Google publisher products. What you need to do Nothing at this time. The Help Center and Policy Center will be updated in September 2019 when this takes effect with the full breakdown of policies and restrictions. At that time, please review the updated policies and restrictions and ensure that your content is in compliance. (Posted August 2019) Give feedback about this article Was this helpful?

If you fail to comply with these policies without permission from Google, we reserve the right to disable ad serving to your site and/or disable your AdSense account at any time. If your account is disabled, you will not be eligible for further participation in the AdSense program. Because we may change our policies at any time, please check here often for updates. In accordance with our online Terms and Conditions, it's your responsibility to keep up to date with, and adhere to, the policies posted here. Exceptions to these policies are permitted only with authorization from Google. Publishers may place AdSense code on pages with content in scope of the Google Publisher Restrictions, though this content will likely receive less advertising than other, nonrestricted content. Expand all Collapse all Invalid clicks and impressions Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods. Learn more Clicks on Google ads must result from genuine user interest. Any method that artificially generates clicks or impressions on your Google ads is strictly prohibited. These prohibited methods include, but are not limited to, repeated manual clicks or impressions, automated click and impression generating tools and the use of robots or deceptive software. Please note that clicking your own ads for any reason is prohibited. Encouraging clicks or views (non-rewarded inventory) Except for rewarded inventory, publishers may not ask others to click or view their ads or use deceptive implementation methods to obtain clicks or views. This includes, but is not limited to, offering compensation to users for viewing ads or performing searches, promising to raise money for third parties for such behavior or placing images next to individual ads. Learn more To ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, publishers participating in the AdSense program may not: Compensate users for viewing ads or performing searches, or promise compensation to a third party for such behavior. Encourage users to click the Google ads using phrases such as \"click the ads\", \"support us\", \"visit these links\" or other similar language. Direct user attention to the ads using arrows or other graphical gimmicks. Place misleading images alongside individual ads. Place ads in a floating box script. Format ads so that they become indistinguishable from other content on that page. Format site content so that it is difficult to distinguish it from ads. Place misleading labels above Google ad units. For instance, ads may be labelled \"Sponsored Links\" or \"Advertisements\", but not \"Favorite Sites\" or \"Today's Top Offers\". Traffic sources Google ads may not be placed on pages receiving traffic from certain sources. For example, publishers may not participate in paid-to-click programs, send unwanted emails or display ads as the result of the action of any software application. Also, publishers using online advertising must ensure that their pages comply with Google's Landing Page Quality Guidelines. Learn more To ensure a positive experience for Internet users and Google advertisers, sites displaying Google ads may not: Use third-party services that generate clicks or impressions such as paid-to-click, paid-to-surf, autosurf and click-exchange programs. Be promoted through unsolicited mass emails or unwanted advertisements on third-party websites. Display Google ads, search boxes or search results as a result of the actions of software applications such as toolbars. Be loaded by any software that can trigger pop-ups, redirect users to unwanted websites, modify browser settings or otherwise interfere with site navigation. It is your responsibility to ensure that no ad network or affiliate uses such methods to direct traffic to pages that contain your AdSense code. Receive traffic from online advertising unless the site complies with the spirit of Google's Landing Page Quality Guidelines. For instance, users should easily be able to find what your ad promises. Ad behavior Publishers are permitted to make modifications to the AdSense ad code so long as those modifications do not artificially inflate ad performance or harm advertisers. Please see modification of the AdSense ad code for more information. Ad placement Publishers are encouraged to experiment with a variety of placements and ad formats. However, AdSense code may not be placed in inappropriate places such as pop-ups, emails or software. Publishers must also adhere to the policies for each product used. Please see our ad placement policies article for more information. View full ad placement policies. Google ads, search boxes or search results may not be: Integrated into a software application (does not apply to AdMob) of any kind, including toolbars. Displayed in pop-ups or pop-unders, including where a page containing Google ads, search boxes, or search results is loaded in a pop-up or pop-under. Placed inside emails, or on pages where email messages are the primary focus. Placed on screens where private communication is the primary focus of the page. Placed on any non-content-based page. (Does not apply to AdSense for search or mobile AdSense for search.) Placed on pages published specifically for the purpose of showing ads. Placed on pages whose content or URL could confuse users into thinking it is associated with Google due to the misuse of logos, trademarks or other brand features. Placed on, within or alongside other Google products or services in a manner that violates the policies of that product or service. Placed on pages that frame content. Framing content is when a site or app displays someone’s else site within a frame or window without permission from the owners of that content. Site behavior Sites showing Google ads should be easy for users to navigate. Sites may not change user preferences, redirect users to unwanted websites, initiate downloads, include malware or contain pop-ups or pop-unders that interfere with site navigation. Deceptive site navigation Publishers may not use deceptive implementation methods that place ads in a way that might be mistaken for menu, navigation or download links to obtain clicks or views. Keep in mind that every publisher is responsible to ensure that their ad implementation adheres to the ad placement policies. This includes, but is not limited to: False claims of streaming content, or downloads Linking to content that doesn’t exist Redirecting users to irrelevant, or misleading webpages Other types of navigation that is designed to intentionally mislead users Pages where ads are implemented in placements that are intuitively meant for navigation. Technical requirements for web content viewing frames for apps App developers who want to monetize by publishing AdSense and Ad Manager display ads through a web content viewing frame must use one of the following integration options: WebView API for Ads App developers are encouraged to integrate the WebView API for Ads to register WebView instances (Android: WebView, iOS: WKWebView) with Google Mobile Ads SDK. Learn more in the developer documentation for Androidand iOS. AdMob and Ad Manager in-app ads may be shown in an app next to a WebView as long as the Google Mobile Ads SDK is in use and the publisher is compliant with all other relevant program policies and guidelines. As a reminder, content in the WebView is subject to the same content policy requirement as when it is in a browser. Other supported viewing frames: Android: Chrome Custom Tabs and Trusted Web Activities iOS: SFSafariViewController (iOS9 and iOS10 only) Sensitive events A \"Sensitive Event\" is an unforeseen event or development that creates significant risk to Google's ability to provide high quality, relevant information and ground truth, and reduce insensitive or exploitative content in prominent and monetized features. During a sensitive event, we may take a variety of actions to address these risks.

If you fail to comply with these policies without permission from Google, we reserve the right to disable ad serving to your site and/or disable your AdSense account at any time. If your account is disabled, you will not be eligible for further participation in the AdSense program. Because we may change our policies at any time, please check here often for updates. In accordance with our online Terms and Conditions, it's your responsibility to keep up to date with, and adhere to, the policies posted here. Exceptions to these policies are permitted only with authorization from Google. Publishers may place AdSense code on pages with content in scope of the Google Publisher Restrictions, though this content will likely receive less advertising than other, nonrestricted content. Expand all Collapse all Invalid clicks and impressions Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods. Learn more Clicks on Google ads must result from genuine user interest. Any method that artificially generates clicks or impressions on your Google ads is strictly prohibited. These prohibited methods include, but are not limited to, repeated manual clicks or impressions, automated click and impression generating tools and the use of robots or deceptive software. Please note that clicking your own ads for any reason is prohibited. Encouraging clicks or views (non-rewarded inventory) Except for rewarded inventory, publishers may not ask others to click or view their ads or use deceptive implementation methods to obtain clicks or views. This includes, but is not limited to, offering compensation to users for viewing ads or performing searches, promising to raise money for third parties for such behavior or placing images next to individual ads. Learn more To ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, publishers participating in the AdSense program may not: Compensate users for viewing ads or performing searches, or promise compensation to a third party for such behavior. Encourage users to click the Google ads using phrases such as \"click the ads\", \"support us\", \"visit these links\" or other similar language. Direct user attention to the ads using arrows or other graphical gimmicks. Place misleading images alongside individual ads. Place ads in a floating box script. Format ads so that they become indistinguishable from other content on that page. Format site content so that it is difficult to distinguish it from ads. Place misleading labels above Google ad units. For instance, ads may be labelled \"Sponsored Links\" or \"Advertisements\", but not \"Favorite Sites\" or \"Today's Top Offers\". Traffic sources Google ads may not be placed on pages receiving traffic from certain sources. For example, publishers may not participate in paid-to-click programs, send unwanted emails or display ads as the result of the action of any software application. Also, publishers using online advertising must ensure that their pages comply with Google's Landing Page Quality Guidelines.

        "content": "Beginner's guideAdSense policies: a beginner's guideNext: Stay compliant with our policiesWe hope that all publishers participating in AdSense have a long and successful partnership with Google. For that to happen, it’s important that you familiarize yourself with the AdSense Program policies. The more you know about our policies, the more likely it is that all sites and pages where you display Google ads will fully comply with these policies. To get you started, we’ve highlighted some of the most important and commonly violated policies below. These simple rules aren't a comprehensive list of our policies, but following them will help keep your account in good standing. Clicks and impressions Our specialists carefully monitor clicks and impressions on Google ads, using both automated systems and human reviews, in order to protect your interests and those of our advertisers. We do this so that we can protect our advertisers from artificially inflated costs. Here are some ways you can help ensure that your sites provide the highest quality traffic possible. Don't click on your own Google ads. If you'd like more information about one of the advertisers appearing on your site, please type the URL of the ad directly into your browser's address bar. Don't ask anyone to click on your Google ads. Encouraging users to click on your Google ads is strictly prohibited -- whether directly or indirectly, on your own site, on third-party sites, or via email. Users should always click on Google ads because they're interested in the services being advertised, not to raise money for your site or for a cause, or to generate some sort of reward for themselves. Choose the location for your ads carefully. Publishers should never use tricks or deceptive practices in order to trigger accidental clicks on ads. Make sure that your ads are well-placed on your site, away from interactive elements, do not mimic the surrounding content and are not placed under misleading headings. Maintain adequate space between the ads and the page controls. For example, on a site with games, try to avoid placing ads too close to the game controls. We generally recommend a minimum distance of 150 pixels between the flash player and the ad. Please don't place content ads on interstitial pages, game interfaces, or sites dedicated to streaming videos. If you'd like to earn from your video-streaming or game interface by overlaying, in-stream, or interstitial placements, check out AdSense for video or the YouTube Partner Program. Be aware of how your site is promoted. Publishers need to be very careful when purchasing traffic or setting up ad campaigns with third parties. Before contracting with any ad network, you should ensure that they will never display your site in pop-ups or as a result of the actions of any software application. Please also keep in mind that publishers using online advertising of any kind must comply Google's Landing Page Quality Guidelines. Use Google Analytics. If you're not yet using Google Analytics, we encourage you to install it to better understand and optimize your site traffic. Knowing where your traffic comes from goes a long way in getting the most from your site. Learn more about Analytics on their site. Or, watch helpful videos on the Analytics YouTube channel. Content guidelines Publishers are responsible for the content on every page displaying their ads, even if the content was created by someone else, such as on sites with user-generated content. Content restrictions apply to pages/sites displaying Google ads. Google ads may not be displayed alongside any type of content prohibited by our Program policies and the Google Publisher Policies. It's your responsibility to ensure that all of your pages adhere to these policies. Create sites with unique and relevant content. Google will take action against domains that don’t add any value to users. Familiarizing yourself with the Spam policies for Google web search will introduce you to some best practices of successful publishers, including: Avoid unnecessary, repeated use of keywords, which don’t add value to the site. Your sites should not claim that they provide content or services that they do not have. Don’t create \"doorway\" pages created just for search engines, or other \"cookie cutter\" approaches such as affiliate programs with little or no original content. Ad implementation Once the code is created in your account it shouldn’t be altered or placed anywhere that violates our ad placement policies such as in pop-ups, in software, or on sites that mimic Google. Don't tamper with the AdSense code. Once you've generated your code, we ask that you do not alter any portion of the code or change the layout, behavior, targeting, or delivery of ads for any reason, unless specifically authorized to do so by Google. Don't use pop-up prompts or automatic software installations. Google is dedicated to improving the user experience on the Internet, and promoting responsible software principles is part of that effort. Sites showing Google ads may not prompt users to install software on their machines. Publishers must also not attempt to change users' browser home pages automatically or via pop-up prompts. Respect Google trademarks. Framing or mimicking Google pages is strictly prohibited by our Guidelines for Use of Google Brand Features. In addition, publishers may not use any Google Brand Features such as Google trademarks, logos, webpages, or screenshots, without prior consent from Google. Disabled ads or account: In the event that we ever disable ads to either your site or to your account, the only way to get your ads re-enabled is to carefully read the notification email and to be responsive to our requests. Be responsive. In case we ever need to contact you about your account, make sure to keep the email address associated with your account up-to-date. Publishers are asked to carefully read emails sent by the AdSense team and to be responsive to our requests. However, being responsive does not mean that you need to write in to us. If we notify you about problems on one site, please also take the time to clean up any other pages or sites to ensure that your entire network of sites complies with all AdSense policies. We constantly review publishers for compliance with AdSense Program policies and rules noted above. If you believe a site showing ads is in violation of these policies, please let us know.

Explore Adsense ad placement policies below. Avoiding accidental clicks Encouraging accidental clicks Unnatural attention to ads Placing ads under a misleading heading Aligning images with ads Formatting content to mimic ads Offering compensation Distance between ads and Flash games Ensuring proper ad placement Auto-refreshing ads Ads in private communications Ads on emails Ads in a software application Ads in a new window Ads in pop-up and pop-under windows Ads on a site with pop-ups or pop-unders Ads on content that we cannot evaluate Ads on the same page or site as another publisher Ads on a hosted site (e.g., Blogger) Avoiding accidental clicks Encouraging accidental clicks Publishers are not permitted to encourage users to click on Google ads in any way. This includes implementing the ads in a way that they might be mistaken for other site content, such as a menu, navigation, or download links. Be careful when placing links, play buttons, download buttons, navigation buttons (e.g., “Previous\" or “Next\"), game windows, video players, drop-down menus, or applications near ads because they might lead to accidental clicks. Even if the layout unintentionally leads to accidental clicks, publishers may still receive a violation notification. For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select \"Subtitles/CC\" and choose your language. Examples of unacceptable implementations Back to top Unnatural attention to ads Publishers are not permitted to bring unnecessary or unnatural attention to their Google ads. Examples of this include: flashy animations that draw a user’s eyes to the ads arrows or other symbols pointing to the ads For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select \"Subtitles/CC\" and choose your language. Examples of unacceptable implementations Back to top Placing ads under a misleading header It's important that visitors to your site are not misled in any way and are able to easily distinguish content from Google Display ads. This policy prohibits placing ads under misleading headings such as \"resources\" or \"helpful links\". Publishers may only label Google ads with either \"Advertisements\" or \"Sponsored Links\". Examples of unacceptable implementations Additionally, as shown below, a site's heading might be interpreted as an inappropriate ad label. Because ads in such a position might be mistaken for links or listings instead of advertisements, such an implementation is considered unacceptable. Monitor your site and its layout carefully to ensure this doesn't happen. Publishers are not allowed to use language to lead users to click the ads, such as: \"Feel free to click an ad.\" \"Contribute to the cause by clicking an ad.\" \"Help keep this site running. Check out our sponsors!\" \"We need a new server. Support us!\" Back to top Aligning images with ads Publishers may not attempt to associate specific images with the individual ads appearing on their sites. Such an implementation might confuse users who assume that the image is directly related to the advertiser's offerings and therefore is a violation of our policies. Examples of unacceptable implementations Back to top Formatting content to mimic ads Publishers may not implement Google ads in a manner that disguises the ads in any way. This includes formatting neighboring content to look similar to the ads. If a publisher places ads on non-Google search results pages, there must be a clear distinction between search results and ads. Review our AdSense for search policies for more information. In the example below, the content is formatted very similarly to the ads and it's difficult to tell them apart. This implementation is not permitted. Examples of unacceptable implementations Back to top Offering compensation Offering compensation or any incentive for clicks on ads is strictly prohibited. Examples of unacceptable implementations Back to top Distance between ads and Flash games When placing Google ads on Flash gaming sites, we strongly recommend a distance of at least 150 pixels between the ads and the edge of a game. When users are concentrating on a Flash game and clicking frantically, invalid clicks are likely to occur. Since each game and site is unique, some games might require a greater distance based on the type of game and how it is played. For more guidelines, review AdSense for content ads on game play pages. Back to top Ensuring proper ad placement Auto-refreshing ads Publishers are not permitted to refresh a page or an element of a page without the user requesting a refresh. This includes placing ads on pages or in placements that auto-redirect or auto-refresh. Additionally, publishers may not display the ads for a preset time (i.e., pre-roll) before users can view content such as videos, games, or downloads. For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select \"Subtitles/CC\" and choose your language. Back to top Ads in private communications Publishers may not place Google ads on screens where private communication between people is the primary focus. Examples of private communication include direct messages, live chats, video-chats, private chatrooms, etc. Back to top Ads on emails To ensure the effectiveness of Google ads for both our publishers and advertisers, publishers may not place Google ads inside email messages. In addition, publishers may not place Google ads alongside email messages when they are the primary focus of the page. Back to top Ads in a software application Publishers are not permitted to distribute Google ads or AdSense for search boxes through software applications including, but not limited to toolbars, browser extensions, and desktop applications. AdSense code may only be implemented on web-based pages and approved WebView technologies. Back to top Ads in a new window Publishers are not permitted to open Google ads in a new window or alter the result of clicking on an ad. For more information, review Opening the ads in a new window. Please note that this policy does not apply for AdSense ads served via dynamic allocation through Google Ad Manager. Back to top Ads in pop-up and pop-under windows Publishers are not permitted to place Google ads in any window that is not initiated by an intentional user interaction (e.g., click). Additionally, Google ads may not be placed in any web browser window that lacks navigational controls, including back and forward browse buttons, and an editable URL field. Back to top Ads on a site with pop-ups or pop-unders Publishers are not permitted to place Google ads on sites which have more than three pop-ups. If pop-ups are displayed on a site, they may not interfere with site navigation, change user preferences, initiate downloads, or distribute viruses. Publishers are not permitted to place Google ads on sites that contain or trigger pop-unders. Additionally, sites using AdSense may not be loaded by any software that triggers pop-ups, modifies browser settings, redirects users to unwanted sites, or otherwise interferes with normal site navigation. It is your responsibility to ensure that no ad network or affiliates use such methods to direct traffic to pages that contain your AdSense code. Back to top Ads on content that we cannot evaluate In order to protect the quality of our ad network, we may disable ad serving on content that cannot be evaluated. This includes but is not limited to content whose robots.txt file blocks Google’s crawling and password-protected content where the publisher has not provided login credentials to Google. Back to top Ads on the same page or site as another publisher If a site is in compliance with our Program policies and the company or owner of the site has given you permission to display ads on their site, you may place your ad code on the same page as the other publisher's ad code. You will, however, need to contact your web hosting company or the owner of the site to obtain permission to display ads on their site. Additionally, you will only be credited for clicks and impressions on the ad units associated with your account. Keep in mind that every publisher is responsible for the content of a site on which their ad code is placed. If a site is found in violation of our policies, we will notify any publisher(s) whose ad code is on the site. Back to top Ads on a hosted site (e.g., Blogger) You are welcome to place the AdSense code on any page which complies with our Program policies, including hosted sites. However, note that in order to use AdSense, you might need to have access to your site's HTML source code. It is also your responsibility to check with your host and determine if using AdSense is a violation of their terms of service.

Publishers who wish to participate in AdMob must comply with our online AdSense program policies, with the additions and exceptions described below. If you fail to comply with these policies, we reserve the right to disable ad serving to your app and/or disable your AdMob account at any time. Exceptions to AdSense policies In principle, all AdMob publishers must follow our online program policies, however there are certain policies that differ between AdSense and AdMob. Please see the exceptions below. View exceptions Ad behavior AdMob has an ad refresh function which can be used by mobile applications that use the Google Mobile Ads SDK. The refresh rate may not be set to a value outside of the range specified in the SDK. Invalid clicks and impressions Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods. Testing your own ads by clicking on them is not allowed. Please use test ads (available for Android, iOS) to avoid generating invalid clicks. Learn more about invalid clicks and impressions Google treats invalid activity very seriously, analyzing all clicks and impressions to determine whether they fit a pattern of use that might artificially drive up an advertiser's costs or a publisher's earnings. If we determine that an AdMob account might pose a risk to our advertisers, we may disable that account to protect our advertisers' interests. Publishers disabled for invalid activity or violating our policies may not be allowed any further participation in other Google publisher monetization solutions. This means, for example, that if a publisher had an AdMob account disabled for invalid activity or policy violations, they would not be able to use AdSense to monetize, and vice versa. For this reason, these publishers may not open new accounts. If a publisher opens additional accounts, the accounts will be flagged as duplicates and then one or both accounts will be disabled. For additional information about invalid activity, please visit our Ad Traffic Quality Resource Center. Ad placement Publishers are encouraged to experiment with a variety of placements and ad formats, but must comply with the Google Publisher Policies. Please also review our implementation guidance. Apps that offer compensation programs Google ads may not be placed on apps that promise payment or incentives to users who click on or view ads. Placing Google ads on such apps may result in invalid impressions or clicks and is therefore prohibited. Similarly, Google ads may not be placed on apps that primarily drive traffic to, promote, or provide instructional materials on how to implement such services. Displaying a third party site in your app When an app displays someone else's site within a frame, this is considered framing content. Publishers are not permitted to frame third party content and monetize it without permission from the owners of that content. If a publisher owns the content, it can be framed in their app and monetized. However, if the framed content is already being monetized by Google Ads, the framed content should not contain any additional code for AdSense or AdMob inside the version on the mobile app. Sub-syndication and ad network mediation Publishers may not enter into sub-syndication relationships (i.e., Google should have a direct relationship with the publisher, rather than through an intermediate party). Learn more about sub-syndication and ad network mediation Restricted information sharing Metrics: Publishers may not share access to the AdMob reporting console (unless with AdMob’s prior written consent on which metrics to share). Code: Publishers may not share either source Google SDK code or uncompiled Google SDK code with any third party. AdMob Mediation AdMob’s network mediation service is intended to enable access to third party ad networks’ first party advertiser demand (as opposed to demand from exchanges, mediators or optimizers). Reporting in AdMob for ads served through AdMob's network mediation features may differ from reporting by third party ad networks. AdMob holds no responsibility for discrepancies in reporting, or for the performance or results of third party ad networks or software. The following policies apply to publishers using AdMob’s network mediation feature or any other mediation feature: Publishers will adhere to the AdSense Program policy for the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA); Publishers must adhere to the Platforms program policies and the Google Publisher Policies; Any additional implementation and technical guidelines as may be provided by AdMob; Publisher may not use AdMob's mediation service in a manner that would violate the Publisher’s agreement(s) with any third party ad network; AdMob revenue share will be paid only to the publisher; AdMob is not obligated to provide support to, guarantee compatibility with, or discuss discrepancy resolution with any third party; and For a given impression, publishers may not make repeated ad calls for Google ads in a manner that attempts to interfere with, abuse, or gain an unfair advantage in the ad auction. For publishers using app platform feature(s), publishers are not permitted to pass the impression opportunity through any intermediary (including publisher’s own system) that dynamically or programmatically allocates ad requests based on actual, estimated, or other real-time pricing information.

While our traffic quality team uses both automatic and manual methods to filter out invalid clicks, we also need publishers to follow our policies in order to reduce the possibility of invalid activity. A general rule of thumb is to always put your users first - make sure your ads don’t draw unnatural attention, mislead users, encourage clicks, or appear in places that may cause invalid clicks. If we find invalid activity in your app(s), you may be at risk for account disablement. We also refund revenue generated from invalid clicks to affected advertisers. To learn more about this, refer to Estimated vs. finalized earnings. As a publisher, you are responsible for ensuring that your ad implementation complies with our AdSense program policies, and that you haven’t paid for traffic from unreliable sources. To learn more about our systems and process for preventing invalid activity, check out the Ad Traffic Quality Resource Center. Here are some additional tips to further help you prevent invalid activity on your apps: Don’t click your own ads, even if you think it’s okay to do so Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods. Testing your own ads by clicking them is not allowed. Use test ads (available for Android, iOS) to avoid generating invalid clicks. Use test ads Clicking live ads in your own app is not allowed. Use test ads to avoid generating invalid clicks. It is important to enable test ads during development so that you can click them without charging Google advertisers. If you click too many ads without being in test mode, your account can be flagged for invalid activity. There are two ways to implement test ads: Use one of Google's sample ad units. Google provides sample ad unit IDs to test your ads. Use your own ad unit and enable test devices. You can configure your device as a test device and use your own ad unit IDs that you've created in the AdMob UI. To implement test ads, follow the instructions on Google Developer for Android and iOS. Understand your ad traffic and app users Break down your traffic reports into meaningful segments using app filters such as app name, ad unit and country. This will help you gauge how changes to traffic sources or implementation can affect your ad traffic. You can use Google Analytics to get detailed information about your app visitors, and be on the lookout for any suspicious user behavior. Some questions to ask yourself: Where do my users come from? How are they interacting with my app? Which screens do they view in my app?

        "content": "AdMob & AdSense program policies How you can prevent invalid activity Next: Estimated vs finalized earnings This article provides guidance on how to avoid invalid activity, such as utilizing test ads, understanding ad traffic patterns, and choosing reputable partners, ensuring a positive experience for both publishers and advertisers. While our traffic quality team uses both automatic and manual methods to filter out invalid clicks, we also need publishers to follow our policies in order to reduce the possibility of invalid activity. A general rule of thumb is to always put your users first - make sure your ads don’t draw unnatural attention, mislead users, encourage clicks, or appear in places that may cause invalid clicks. If we find invalid activity in your app(s), you may be at risk for account disablement. We also refund revenue generated from invalid clicks to affected advertisers. To learn more about this, refer to Estimated vs. finalized earnings. As a publisher, you are responsible for ensuring that your ad implementation complies with our AdSense program policies, and that you haven’t paid for traffic from unreliable sources. To learn more about our systems and process for preventing invalid activity, check out the Ad Traffic Quality Resource Center. Here are some additional tips to further help you prevent invalid activity on your apps: Don’t click your own ads, even if you think it’s okay to do so Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods. Testing your own ads by clicking them is not allowed. Use test ads (available for Android, iOS) to avoid generating invalid clicks. Use test ads Clicking live ads in your own app is not allowed. Use test ads to avoid generating invalid clicks. It is important to enable test ads during development so that you can click them without charging Google advertisers. If you click too many ads without being in test mode, your account can be flagged for invalid activity. There are two ways to implement test ads: Use one of Google's sample ad units. Google provides sample ad unit IDs to test your ads. Use your own ad unit and enable test devices. You can configure your device as a test device and use your own ad unit IDs that you've created in the AdMob UI. To implement test ads, follow the instructions on Google Developer for Android and iOS. Understand your ad traffic and app users Break down your traffic reports into meaningful segments using app filters such as app name, ad unit and country. This will help you gauge how changes to traffic sources or implementation can affect your ad traffic. You can use Google Analytics to get detailed information about your app visitors, and be on the lookout for any suspicious user behavior. Some questions to ask yourself: Where do my users come from? How are they interacting with my app? Which screens do they view in my app?

To ensure a positive experience for publishers, users and advertisers, we have set out requirements below on the nature and implementation of ad units that offer rewards via Google-served ads (\"Rewarded Ads\"). For the purposes of these policies: \"Direct monetary items\" mean any form of legal tender, or other modes of payment that can be used directly to purchase goods or services in the real world. Examples: Cash, cryptocurrency, gift card \"Indirect or non-monetary items\" mean anything with monetary value but which is not a direct mode of payment in the real world, or anything that does not have monetary value in the real world. Examples: Discounts, loyalty rewards or points, product free shipping, product or service free trial, game character extra life, game character skin \"Non-transferable\" means a reward that is only redeemable and usable by the same user who received it, and is not directly convertible into direct monetary items or items that can be transferred to a third party. Examples: A discount code, loyalty points or a game item that is only redeemable and usable by a specific user through their logged-in account, and cannot be directly converted into cash or used to purchase any item that can be transferred to another person Rewards requirements Direct monetary items may not be offered as rewards under any circumstance. Indirect or non-monetary items may be offered as rewards, provided that: The reward is only redeemable and usable for an item or service within the publisher’s platform, website or app; The reward is non-transferable (for example, physical items or loyalty points that can be transferred to another person are not permitted); and Rewards that are a discount or voucher for physical items must not exceed 25% of the item’s total value. Random rewards are allowed, provided that: The chance of random rewards is disclosed to the user prior to Rewarded Ads being presented (such as by indicating \"watch this ad now for a chance to receive a random reward\"); Details on all possible rewards are made easily accessible to the user (such as by indicating possible rewards in the disclosure, a hover-over, or by including a link to a page with details). This includes stating if not receiving a reward is a possible outcome; and The chance for receiving a reward must be greater than 0. Implementation requirements Publishers must provide clear, accurate and conspicuous disclosure of the action(s) required and reward(s) offered prior to each instance of Rewarded Ads being presented. Icons may be used to describe the action(s) or reward(s), provided that such icons are clearly and unambiguously understandable by users. If Rewarded Ads are presented in a bundle, or require users to watch a fixed number of Rewarded Ads to obtain a reward, such details must be clearly disclosed to the user (such as by indicating \"watch 3 ads now to receive 100 gold coins\"). Rewarded Ads, except those implemented via the rewarded interstitial format, must only be served after a user affirmatively and unambiguously opts in (such as by tapping a button that represents \"yes\" or \"accept\"). In addition: Rewarded Ads must not oblige users to interact with it (for example, it must be possible to skip or dismiss them). Rewarded Ads implemented via the rewarded interstitial format must present an introductory screen containing an option representing \"no\" or \"don’t accept\", with sufficient time for the user to opt out. This option must not be hidden, obstructed, or non-functional. Skipping the Rewarded Ad or selecting the \"no\" or \"don’t accept\" option must not impede or interfere with the normal usage of the platform, website or app. Publishers must not include any text or icons, other than to describe the reward(s) offered, to mislead or incentivize users towards a particular choice (such as by indicating \"watch this ad to support our business\"). Publishers must deliver the promised reward(s) to the user upon completion of the required action(s). Publishers are fully and solely responsible for the granting of the rewards, and must not state or imply that rewards are verified or endorsed by Google.

        "content": "Shopping ads policies As part of our recent suspension of ads in Russia, we will also pause ads on Google properties and networks globally for advertisers based in Russia. Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing Google ads from serving to users located in Russia. Welcome to the Shopping ads Policy Center Overview of our Shopping ads policies and how we enforce them We strive to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem – one that’s trustworthy and transparent, and works for customers, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this Policy Center is to help you build Shopping ads and local inventory ads campaigns that align with both our ads policies and the Shopping ads policies listed below. These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our customers and abide by applicable laws. This means that our policies prohibit content that is harmful to customers and the overall advertising ecosystem. Our Shopping ads policies cover four broad areas: Prohibited content: Content you're not allowed to promote on the Google Network Prohibited practices: Things you can't do if you want to advertise with us Restricted content: Content you can advertise, but with limitations Editorial and technical: Quality standards for your ads and website Click through the policies below for policy definitions, examples, and troubleshooting steps. We use a combination of Google AI and human evaluation to ensure that Shopping ads comply with these policies. Our enforcement technologies use Google AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our customers and keep our ad platforms safe. More complex, nuanced or severe cases are often reviewed and evaluated by our specially-trained experts. We take action on content that violates our policies. This may include disapproving violating Shopping ads so they don’t serve, temporarily capping ad impressions for some accounts flagged by Google AI, and suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions we take. If one of your Shopping ads is disapproved, you can fix that shopping ad or appeal the decision. You can also appeal an account suspension decision (for this link to work, you’ll need to be signed into your Google Ads account). Prohibited content Counterfeit goods Google prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit products. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark or logo of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner. This policy applies to the content of your Shopping ads and your website. Dangerous products Google wants to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don’t allow the promotion of some products that cause damage, harm, or injury. Examples of dangerous content: Recreational drugs (chemical or herbal); psychoactive substances; equipment to facilitate drug use; weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and fireworks; instructions for making explosives or other harmful products; tobacco products. Products that enable dishonest behavior Google values honesty and fairness, so we don’t allow the promotion of products that are designed to enable dishonest behavior. Examples of products that enable dishonest behavior: Hacking software or instructions; fake documents; academic cheating products. Inappropriate content Google values diversity and respect for others, and we strive to avoid offending users, so we don’t allow ads or destinations that display shocking content or promote hatred, intolerance, discrimination, or violence. Examples of inappropriate or offensive content: Bullying or intimidation of an individual or group; racial discrimination; hate group paraphernalia; graphic crime scene or accident images; cruelty to animals; murder; self-harm; extortion or blackmail; sale or trade of endangered species. Unsupported Shopping ads content Google aims to enable businesses to promote a wide variety of products, but some Google products and platforms may not be optimized to appropriately support all content types. For this reason, Shopping ads and free product listings don't allow the promotion of certain content where we don't offer an optimal user experience. Note that because these limitations are specific to Shopping ads and free listings, they do not impact policies on other Google products or platforms, where functionality differs or additional support mechanisms are in place. Prohibited practices Abuse of the ad network Google wants Shopping ads to be useful, varied, relevant, and safe for users, so we don’t allow any of the following: Malicious content Sites that offer little unique value to users and are focused on traffic generation Retailers who try to gain an unfair advantage in Shopping campaigns Retailers who try to bypass our review processes Irresponsible data collection & use Google wants users to trust that information about them will be respected and handled with appropriate care. As such, our advertising partners should not misuse this information, nor collect it for unclear purposes or without appropriate security measures. Examples of user information that must be handled with care: full name; email address; mailing address; phone number; national identity, pension, social security, tax ID, health care, or driver's license number; birth date or mother's maiden name in addition to any of the above information; financial status; political affiliation; sexual orientation; race or ethnicity; religion.

For this reason we don’t allow the following: Promotions that prompt users to initiate a purchase, download, or other commitment without first providing all relevant information and obtaining the user’s explicit consent Promotions that represent you or your products in a way that is not accurate, realistic, and truthful Restricted content The policies below cover content that is sometimes legally or culturally sensitive. Online promotion can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate. For that reason, we allow promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and merchants may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all products, features, or networks are able to support this restricted content.

Political content When you promote political content, you must comply with the following requirements: Applicable laws and industry standards for any location that you target Any applicable election \"silence periods\" Examples of political content: promotion of political parties/candidates, political issue advocacy. Trademarks Shopping ads don’t restrict use of trademarks by merchants in the title or description of an ad when it’s for a trademarked product or a product compatible with the trademarked product. Merchants need to reference trademarks to be able to communicate to users what they're offering, and users need that information as it's relevant to their searches. We’ll review claims by trademark owners that use of their trademark is likely to cause consumer confusion about the origin of a product. To submit a trademark-related complaint if you’re an owner of the trademark, use the Report a legal issue in Shopping ads form. High Fat Sugar Salt Food and Beverage We support responsible advertising of food and beverages. High Fat Sugar Salt (HFSS) Food & Beverage (F&B) Shopping ads are allowed if they comply with our policies. We consider ads to be promoting the sale of HFSS products when one or more HFSS food item, beverage, or meal is promoted in the ad (text, imagery, audio and/or video) or destination site. Specifically, Shopping ads that contain HFSS foods and beverages are now prohibited from targeting minors. The information reflected in this policy is not intended to be legal advice and we expect all merchants and partners to comply with the local laws for any region their ads target, including local requirements that may differ from this HFSS Food & Beverage policy. Editorial & technical requirements We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users. We've also specified technical requirements to help users and advertisers get the most out of the variety of ad formats we offer. Editorial & professional requirements To provide a quality customer experience, Google requires that all Shopping ads meet high professional and editorial standards. We only allow promotions that are clear and professional in appearance. These ads should lead customers to products and landing pages that are relevant, useful, and easy to interact with. Examples of promotions that don't meet these editorial and professional requirements: a display URL that does not accurately reflect the URL of the landing page, such as \"google.com\" taking users to \"gmail.com\" gimmicky use of words, numbers, letters, punctuation, or symbols such as FREE, f-r-e-e, and F₹€€!! sites that are under construction, parked domains, or are just not working sites that have disabled the browser's back button sites that are not viewable in commonly used browsers About our policies Shopping ads enable businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they view. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, and operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network. Google requires that advertisers comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, and any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing. In cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us. Advertisers have a responsibility to not promote content, or engage in behavior that risks harm to our users, employees, or the Ads ecosystem. If we find such content or behavior, we may take action, including but not limited to restricting or blocking your ads or suspending your account. If you’re working with a third-party platform, some of these instructions may not apply to you. Refer to your third-party platform for instructions on how to resolve the issue and request a review.

        "content": "Shopping ads policies As part of our recent suspension of ads in Russia, we will also pause ads on Google properties and networks globally for advertisers based in Russia. Due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, we will be temporarily pausing Google ads from serving to users located in Russia. Welcome to the Shopping ads Policy Center Overview of our Shopping ads policies and how we enforce them We strive to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem – one that’s trustworthy and transparent, and works for customers, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this Policy Center is to help you build Shopping ads and local inventory ads campaigns that align with both our ads policies and the Shopping ads policies listed below. These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our customers and abide by applicable laws. This means that our policies prohibit content that is harmful to customers and the overall advertising ecosystem. Our Shopping ads policies cover four broad areas: Prohibited content: Content you're not allowed to promote on the Google Network Prohibited practices: Things you can't do if you want to advertise with us Restricted content: Content you can advertise, but with limitations Editorial and technical: Quality standards for your ads and website Click through the policies below for policy definitions, examples, and troubleshooting steps. We use a combination of Google AI and human evaluation to ensure that Shopping ads comply with these policies. Our enforcement technologies use Google AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our customers and keep our ad platforms safe. More complex, nuanced or severe cases are often reviewed and evaluated by our specially-trained experts. We take action on content that violates our policies. This may include disapproving violating Shopping ads so they don’t serve, temporarily capping ad impressions for some accounts flagged by Google AI, and suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions we take. If one of your Shopping ads is disapproved, you can fix that shopping ad or appeal the decision. You can also appeal an account suspension decision (for this link to work, you’ll need to be signed into your Google Ads account). Prohibited content Counterfeit goods Google prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit products. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark or logo of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner. This policy applies to the content of your Shopping ads and your website. Dangerous products Google wants to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don’t allow the promotion of some products that cause damage, harm, or injury. Examples of dangerous content: Recreational drugs (chemical or herbal); psychoactive substances; equipment to facilitate drug use; weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and fireworks; instructions for making explosives or other harmful products; tobacco products. Products that enable dishonest behavior Google values honesty and fairness, so we don’t allow the promotion of products that are designed to enable dishonest behavior. Examples of products that enable dishonest behavior: Hacking software or instructions; fake documents; academic cheating products. Inappropriate content Google values diversity and respect for others, and we strive to avoid offending users, so we don’t allow ads or destinations that display shocking content or promote hatred, intolerance, discrimination, or violence. Examples of inappropriate or offensive content: Bullying or intimidation of an individual or group; racial discrimination; hate group paraphernalia; graphic crime scene or accident images; cruelty to animals; murder; self-harm; extortion or blackmail; sale or trade of endangered species. Unsupported Shopping ads content Google aims to enable businesses to promote a wide variety of products, but some Google products and platforms may not be optimized to appropriately support all content types. For this reason, Shopping ads and free product listings don't allow the promotion of certain content where we don't offer an optimal user experience. Note that because these limitations are specific to Shopping ads and free listings, they do not impact policies on other Google products or platforms, where functionality differs or additional support mechanisms are in place. Prohibited practices Abuse of the ad network Google wants Shopping ads to be useful, varied, relevant, and safe for users, so we don’t allow any of the following: Malicious content Sites that offer little unique value to users and are focused on traffic generation Retailers who try to gain an unfair advantage in Shopping campaigns Retailers who try to bypass our review processes Irresponsible data collection & use Google wants users to trust that information about them will be respected and handled with appropriate care. As such, our advertising partners should not misuse this information, nor collect it for unclear purposes or without appropriate security measures. Examples of user information that must be handled with care: full name; email address; mailing address; phone number; national identity, pension, social security, tax ID, health care, or driver's license number; birth date or mother's maiden name in addition to any of the above information; financial status; political affiliation; sexual orientation; race or ethnicity; religion. Examples of irresponsible data collection and use: Obtaining the following data over non-secure SSL (https://) server connections: Username or email in combination with passwords Credit and debit card numbers Bank and investment account numbers Checking account numbers Wire transfer numbers National identity, pension, social security, tax ID, health care, or driver's license number Misrepresentation Google doesn't want users to feel misled by the content promoted in Shopping ads, and that means being upfront, honest, and providing them with the information that they need to make informed decisions.

Select the settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select \"Subtitles/CC\" and choose your language. To ensure the success of your products and to provide a good experience for potential customers, we've developed a set of policies and data quality requirements for Merchant Center. If your product data and website don't comply with our policies, your products might get disapproved or your account could be suspended. These issues can prevent your products from showing on Google. In this article: Product-level issues Account-level issues Request a review Product-level issues Product-level issues can occur if the product data you provide doesn’t match the product information on your website, if your product data doesn’t follow the product data specification, or if your products violate our Shopping policy requirements. Product-level issues only affect individual products, not your entire account. Issues for the offer are isolated to that product and don’t impact the status of other products. Note: Products targeting multiple countries may receive different disapprovals or warnings for each country due to location-based policy differences. There are 2 types of product-level issues: Warnings: Products that receive warnings will continue to show across Google, however their performance may be limited. If warnings aren't resolved, they can lead to disapprovals. Disapprovals: Disapproved products stop showing across Google. The product-level issue will need to be fixed before the product can be re-approved. Preemptive item disapproval (PID): Preemptive item disapproval (PID) occurs if the price or availability of your products don't match between your product data and website landing pages. When a PID is in place, we err on the side of caution and disapprove products that are likely to violate our requirements. A review is required to resolve these issues. Common website issues that can lead to product disapprovals include: Use of placeholder content Broken links Missing or inconsistent information Inaccurate product descriptions Mismatched categories between your website and product data To avoid potential issues, ensure your product details, descriptions, and categories are consistent across your website and product data feed. You can also turn on automatic item updates to help reduce the risk of preemptive product disapproval for price and availability mismatches. Finding and resolving product-level issues: All product-level issues can be found by selecting the “Needs attention” tab. All issues associated with a particular product can be found in the “Needs attention” section on the product details page for that particular product. To review all of your disapproved products though, follow these steps: Instructions to review disapproved products In your Google Merchant Center account, click Products . Go to the “Needs attention” tab. Under “All products that need attention”, you'll find a list of all the products in your account that have an issue and need attention. You can click the filter icon to filter this list by issue impact, labels, status, title, or what needs attention. To download a complete list (.csv) of all affected items, click the download icon . It’s recommended that you fix product-level issues by editing your product data to correct the issue and then re-uploading your product data via your chosen upload method (such as a file). Each product-level issue also contains a “Learn more” link that directs you to specific instructions for fixing the issue. To help fix disapprovals related to promotional overlay on images, we recommend you enable automatic image improvements. This feature will try to automatically fix these images by removing promotional overlays. If the removal is successful, the image will be replaced and the products will be reapproved. Account-level issues Account-level issues impact all of your products in Merchant Center. There are 2 types of account-level issues: Warnings: If Google finds that your product data or website aren’t in compliance with the product data requirements or violate our Shopping policy requirements, you may receive a warning email with examples of the issues that you need to fix and a warning period in which to fix them. During the warning period your products will continue to appear across Google, however their performance may be limited. Suspensions: If you don't manually request a review during the warning period, your product data and website will be reviewed once more at the end of the warning period. If all your issues are resolved, the warning will be lifted and your products will show as normal. If any of the issues aren't resolved, your account will be suspended and your products will be disabled from appearing across Google. You’ll also receive an email containing all the relevant information and notifying you that your account has been suspended. Note: In some cases when an egregious account-level issue is detected, no warning is given and the account is suspended immediately. Initial review: When you upload products to your account for the first time, your products and website will be subject to an initial review to ensure they meet our Shopping policy requirements. However, the following requirements need to be met before a feed can be sent for review: Review requirements Your account must have shipping settings that are set up on the account or item-level Note: Applicable only for countries where shipping is required Your account must have a feed that was created for the target country Your account must have a URL that is claimed and verified Your account must have a verified business address United States only: Your account must have tax settings set up at the account or item level The review process can take up to 3-5 business days for Shopping ads but may be longer for other programs. During that time, your products will remain in a “Pending” status. Additional changes to your product data and website may further delay the review process. If the review reveals that your products or website don’t comply with our Shopping policies, your account will be suspended immediately and you’ll receive a notification email with further details. If the review is successful, your products will become eligible to serve across Google. Finding and resolving account-level issues: Account-level issues show in a banner at the top of your Merchant Center account. You can click Review and fix or Fix in the banner to follow the in-product flow to resolve your account-level issue. You may also view account-level issues by following these steps: Instructions to view account-level issues In your Google Merchant Center account, click Products . Under the “Needs attention” tab and above the summary cards, click View setup and policy issues. Follow the in-product flow to resolve your account-level issues. Request a review If your account or product gets disapproved you can either fix the problem and request a review, or disagree with the issue and request a review. There may be additional steps you can take, such as verification options, depending on the issue. If the review is successful, your issue will disappear. In some cases, there's a limit on how many reviews you can request. This limit will be specified. If the disapproval remains and you’re uncertain with how to proceed, contact us for support. Note: If you use a third-party platform to list your products, you may also be able to go to your third-party application to request a review.

Select the settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select \"Subtitles/CC\" and choose your language. To ensure the success of your products and to provide a good experience for potential customers, we've developed a set of policies and data quality requirements for Merchant Center. If your product data and website don't comply with our policies, your products might get disapproved or your account could be suspended. These issues can prevent your products from showing on Google. In this article: Product-level issues Account-level issues Request a review Product-level issues Product-level issues can occur if the product data you provide doesn’t match the product information on your website, if your product data doesn’t follow the product data specification, or if your products violate our Shopping policy requirements. Product-level issues only affect individual products, not your entire account. Issues for the offer are isolated to that product and don’t impact the status of other products. Note: Products targeting multiple countries may receive different disapprovals or warnings for each country due to location-based policy differences. There are 2 types of product-level issues: Warnings: Products that receive warnings will continue to show across Google, however their performance may be limited. If warnings aren't resolved, they can lead to disapprovals. Disapprovals: Disapproved products stop showing across Google. The product-level issue will need to be fixed before the product can be re-approved. Preemptive item disapproval (PID): Preemptive item disapproval (PID) occurs if the price or availability of your products don't match between your product data and website landing pages. When a PID is in place, we err on the side of caution and disapprove products that are likely to violate our requirements. A review is required to resolve these issues. Common website issues that can lead to product disapprovals include: Use of placeholder content Broken links Missing or inconsistent information Inaccurate product descriptions Mismatched categories between your website and product data To avoid potential issues, ensure your product details, descriptions, and categories are consistent across your website and product data feed. You can also turn on automatic item updates to help reduce the risk of preemptive product disapproval for price and availability mismatches. Finding and resolving product-level issues: All product-level issues can be found by selecting the “Needs attention” tab. All issues associated with a particular product can be found in the “Needs attention” section on the product details page for that particular product. To review all of your disapproved products though, follow these steps: Instructions to review disapproved products In your Google Merchant Center account, click Products . Go to the “Needs attention” tab. Under “All products that need attention”, you'll find a list of all the products in your account that have an issue and need attention. You can click the filter icon to filter this list by issue impact, labels, status, title, or what needs attention. To download a complete list (.csv) of all affected items, click the download icon . It’s recommended that you fix product-level issues by editing your product data to correct the issue and then re-uploading your product data via your chosen upload method (such as a file). Each product-level issue also contains a “Learn more” link that directs you to specific instructions for fixing the issue.

How does the ad format work? Skippable in-stream ads play before, during, or after other videos or as a full screen interstitial ad that plays before a viewer can proceed within a mobile app. After 5 seconds, the viewer has an option to skip the ad. Where does the ad format appear? Skippable in-stream ads appear on YouTube watch pages and across websites and apps running on Google video partners. How will I be charged? With CPV bidding, you pay when a viewer watches 30 seconds of your video, or the entire duration of the video if it's shorter than 30 seconds, or interacts with your video, whichever comes first. With Target CPM, Target CPA, and Maximize conversions bidding, you pay based on impressions. Which campaign goal do I need to select to use this ad format? Sales Leads Website traffic Awareness and consideration Note: You can also use this ad format when you choose \"Create a campaign without a goal's guidance\" in Google Ads.

Use non-skippable in-stream ads when you have video content you'd like to promote before, during, or after other videos on YouTube and across websites and apps running on Google video partners and you want viewers to view the entire message without skipping your video.

Vertical-friendly video ads Optimize your App, Performance Max, and Video campaigns by having vertical videos in your creative assets as a best practice. The mobile-friendly, full-screen experience of vertical videos can help improve your campaign’s engagement with mobile video viewers. For YouTube, vertical videos are supported in all video eligible campaigns with possible placements in-feed, in-stream, on YouTube Search, and YouTube Shorts. In some cases, just by adding a vertical video asset to a Video action campaign can deliver 10-20% more conversions compared to just having horizontal videos for YouTube Shorts. Outside of YouTube, your ads also run on Google video partners to reach more people. A large share of Google video partners inventory is vertical-focused, like gaming and video apps, to further utilize your vertical and square video assets. To start creating vertical video assets, learn more about video creation in Google Ads. Note: Vertical videos may also be served in-feed to people using desktops as your best performing assets are served based on user behavior and environment. In-feed video ads When should I use this ad format? Use in-feed video ads to promote video content in places of discovery, including next to related YouTube videos, as part of a YouTube search result, or on the YouTube mobile homepage. How does the ad format work? In-feed video ads consist of a thumbnail image from your video with some text. While the exact size and appearance of the ad may vary depending on where it appears, in-feed video ads always invite people to click to watch the video. The video then plays on the YouTube watch page or channel homepage. Where does the ad format appear? In-feed video ads appear: On YouTube search results Alongside related YouTube videos On the YouTube mobile homepage Note: When part of a Video action campaign, in-feed video ads include 2 call-to-action (CTA) buttons. One CTA links to the Final URL specified in the ad, while the other CTA links to the video. When users click on the video, they will also be directed to the landing page, which is shown by the arrow icon in the bottom right corner of the ad. When part of a Video reach or Video view campaign, in-feed video ads will have no arrow icon, and clicking the ad directly leads to the video. When opted into Google Video Partners (GVP) and opted into “In-feed ads”, video ad formats will appear in-stream, in-feed, in-article or in-app (rewarded or interstitial) across video partners on the Google Display Network. How will I be charged? You'll only be charged when someone clicks to watch the ad, or in some cases, when they watch it autoplay for at least 10 seconds.

Bumper ads appear on YouTube videos and across websites and apps running on Google video partners. How will I be charged? Bumper ads use Target CPM bidding, so you pay based on impressions. Which campaign goal do I need to select to use this ad format? Awareness and consideration Note: You can also use this ad format when you choose \"Create a campaign without a goal's guidance\" in Google Ads. Masthead ads When should I use this ad format? Use this format when you want to drive awareness for a new product or service or reach a massive audience in a short period of time, for example, a sales event. Masthead ads are only available on a reservation basis through a Google sales representative. How does the ad format work? Desktop A featured video in a Masthead ad autoplays without the sound for up to 30 seconds at the top of the YouTube Home feed. The Masthead ad can appear in a widescreen or 16:9 aspect ratio format and includes an information panel to the right that automatically uses assets from your channel. You can optionally include up to 2 companion videos in this panel. People can click the mute icon if they want to hear sound from the video. After autoplay, the main video defaults to the video thumbnail. When people click on the video or click on the thumbnail, they’re taken to the YouTube watch page for the video. Mobile A featured video in a Masthead ad autoplays without the sound for the full duration of the video at the top of the YouTube app or m.youtube.com Home feed. The mobile video Masthead ad features a video thumbnail, customizable headline, description texts and an external call-to-action (CTA). The mobile video Masthead ad also automatically pulls in the channel name and icon from the advertiser’s channel. When a user clicks on the mobile video Masthead ad, it will exit to the YouTube watch page for the featured video. TV screens A featured video in a Masthead ad autoplays (where supported) without the sound for the full duration of the video at the top of the YouTube app for TVs. The Masthead ad can appear in a widescreen or 16:9 aspect ratio format. People can use their TV remote to interact with the Masthead ad. After autoplay, the main video defaults to the video thumbnail. When people click on the video or thumbnail, they're taken to the watch page for the video to watch full-screen. You can’t add a CTA to a Masthead ad on TV screens. How will I be charged? Because Masthead ads are only available on a reservation basis, you’re charged on a cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) basis. You can work with the Google advertising team to get a rate estimate and campaign impression goals. YouTube Shorts ads When should I use this ad format? Use this format when you have video content that you would like to promote between Shorts in the Shorts feed on YouTube, reaching a large audience of engaged viewers in a mobile-optimized experience. How does the ad format work? Shorts ads have a similar user experience as organic Shorts videos. Ads will be rendered and show up randomly between organic Shorts videos. Users can immediately skip the ad by swiping up or down. The ad video will be kept and reshown if users scroll back. Clicking on the CTA button will land users to the designated landing page Where does the ad format appear? Shorts ads serve on tablets, mobile apps, and connected devices like streaming devices, gaming consoles, and TVs. How will I be charged? For Shorts ads, you are charged for an impression, view, or engagement. A view is counted: After 10 seconds of autoplay After a click (if the creative loops, you are only charged once and counted as one view) If the minimum ad length is 6 seconds, after watching a <10 second ad to 100% completion A click on a Shorts ad means a click on the Call To Action (CTA); pausing the ad will not count as a click. An impression on Shorts is when playback starts, and a viewable impression is 2 seconds. You are charged on Impression if you have Target CPM (Cost-per-thousand-impressions) bidding. An engagement occurs on Shorts when the user views 5 seconds of the ad or clicks on the CTA.

A large share of Google video partners inventory is vertical-focused, like gaming and video apps, to further utilize your vertical and square video assets.

Use in-feed video ads to promote video content in places of discovery, including next to related YouTube videos, as part of a YouTube search result, or on the YouTube mobile homepage. How does the ad format work? In-feed video ads consist of a thumbnail image from your video with some text.

The video then plays on the YouTube watch page or channel homepage. Where does the ad format appear?

One CTA links to the Final URL specified in the ad, while the other CTA links to the video. When users click on the video, they will also be directed to the landing page, which is shown by the arrow icon in the bottom right corner of the ad. When part of a Video reach or Video view campaign, in-feed video ads will have no arrow icon, and clicking the ad directly leads to the video. When opted into Google Video Partners (GVP) and opted into “In-feed ads”, video ad formats will appear in-stream, in-feed, in-article or in-app (rewarded or interstitial) across video partners on the Google Display Network.

Use this format when you want to drive awareness for a new product or service or reach a massive audience in a short period of time, for example, a sales event. Masthead ads are only available on a reservation basis through a Google sales representative. How does the ad format work? Desktop A featured video in a Masthead ad autoplays without the sound for up to 30 seconds at the top of the YouTube Home feed. The Masthead ad can appear in a widescreen or 16:9 aspect ratio format and includes an information panel to the right that automatically uses assets from your channel. You can optionally include up to 2 companion videos in this panel. People can click the mute icon if they want to hear sound from the video. After autoplay, the main video defaults to the video thumbnail. When people click on the video or click on the thumbnail, they’re taken to the YouTube watch page for the video. Mobile A featured video in a Masthead ad autoplays without the sound for the full duration of the video at the top of the YouTube app or m.youtube.com Home feed. The mobile video Masthead ad features a video thumbnail, customizable headline, description texts and an external call-to-action (CTA). The mobile video Masthead ad also automatically pulls in the channel name and icon from the advertiser’s channel. When a user clicks on the mobile video Masthead ad, it will exit to the YouTube watch page for the featured video. TV screens A featured video in a Masthead ad autoplays (where supported) without the sound for the full duration of the video at the top of the YouTube app for TVs. The Masthead ad can appear in a widescreen or 16:9 aspect ratio format. People can use their TV remote to interact with the Masthead ad.

You can’t add a CTA to a Masthead ad on TV screens. How will I be charged? Because Masthead ads are only available on a reservation basis, you’re charged on a cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) basis. You can work with the Google advertising team to get a rate estimate and campaign impression goals. YouTube Shorts ads When should I use this ad format? Use this format when you have video content that you would like to promote between Shorts in the Shorts feed on YouTube, reaching a large audience of engaged viewers in a mobile-optimized experience. How does the ad format work? Shorts ads have a similar user experience as organic Shorts videos. Ads will be rendered and show up randomly between organic Shorts videos. Users can immediately skip the ad by swiping up or down. The ad video will be kept and reshown if users scroll back. Clicking on the CTA button will land users to the designated landing page Where does the ad format appear? Shorts ads serve on tablets, mobile apps, and connected devices like streaming devices, gaming consoles, and TVs. How will I be charged? For Shorts ads, you are charged for an impression, view, or engagement. A view is counted: After 10 seconds of autoplay After a click (if the creative loops, you are only charged once and counted as one view) If the minimum ad length is 6 seconds, after watching a <10 second ad to 100% completion A click on a Shorts ad means a click on the Call To Action (CTA); pausing the ad will not count as a click. An impression on Shorts is when playback starts, and a viewable impression is 2 seconds. You are charged on Impression if you have Target CPM (Cost-per-thousand-impressions) bidding. An engagement occurs on Shorts when the user views 5 seconds of the ad or clicks on the CTA.

We’ve removed the individual ad choices for pre-roll, post-roll, skippable, and non-skippable ads. Now, when you turn on ads for new long-form videos, we show your viewers pre-roll, post-roll, skippable, or non-skippable ads when appropriate. This change makes the recommended best practice to turn on all ad formats, the standard for everyone. Your choices for mid-roll ads haven’t changed.

This article aims to help you understand which individual videos or Shorts on your channel are suitable for advertisers. Creators can use this article to understand both the platform’s self-certification questionnaire and specific rules about what may earn ad revenue, may earn limited or no ad revenue and what will earn no ad revenue. Our policies apply to all portions of your content (video, Short, or live stream, thumbnail, title, description, and tags). Learn more about our best practices. Our systems don't always get it right, but you can request human review of decisions made by our automated systems. Subscribe to the YouTube Creators channel for the latest news, updates, and tips. Note: All content uploaded to YouTube must comply with both our Community Guidelines and our Program Policies. If your content violates our Community Guidelines, it may be removed from YouTube. If you see violative content, you can report it. What you'll find in this article You'll find examples of content not suitable for ads, and may result in a \"limited or no ads\" monetization state. Here are all the main topics that are not advertiser-friendly: Inappropriate language Violence Adult content Shocking content Harmful acts and unreliable content Hateful & derogatory content Recreational drugs and drug-related content Firearms-related content Controversial issues Sensitive events Enabling dishonest behavior Inappropriate content for kids and families Incendiary and demeaning Tobacco-related content To learn more about key terms used throughout these guidelines, see our table of definitions. Please note that context is very important. Artistic content such as music videos may contain elements such as inappropriate language, references to soft drug use, or non-explicit sexual themes, and still be suitable for advertising. Opening all of the policy details at once can help if you would like to search this page for specific terms. Click here to open all of the guides. Inappropriate language Content that contains profanity or vulgarity at the start or throughout the majority of the video may not be suitable for advertising. Occasional use of profanity (such as in music videos, backing tracks, intro/outro music, or music played in the background) won’t necessarily result in your video being unsuitable for advertising. Policy Detail Ads guidance Questionnaire options & details This content can earn ad revenue Abbreviated or obscured profanity, or words like “hell” or “damn” in the title, thumbnail, or video. Moderate profanity like “bitch”, “douchebag”, \"asshole\", and “shit” used frequently in the video. Most profanity used within music or stand-up comedy video content. Definitions: “Obscured profanity” refers to things like bleeping or muting the word as well as covering written words with black bars, symbols, or text added in post-production. “Abbreviated profanity” refers to an acronym like WTF (“what the f*ck”) where the original term is abbreviated by using its acronyms.

Artistic “Artistic” refers to art intended to express human creativity such as painting, drawings, architecture, sculpture, literature, poetry, music, performing, and scripted content. An example would be a video of a poetry recital. Dramatized “Dramatized” refers to scripted content such as movies or fictional settings including animated content.

Focus need not be verbal. If there is an image or text that focuses on the sensitive issue, that would be considered focus too. Some examples include: A video focused on how to perform self-harm. Content only focused on using strong profanities without other context or reason. Fleeting “Fleeting” refers to moments that are not the focus of content (not focal), and include passing references to topics listed as controversial or sensitive.

The following terms are contextually related: “Documentary” refers to memorializing and preserving historic events by quoting original documents or describing facts, such as in a history of Ancient Egypt. “Scientific” refers to advancing inquiry through scientific experimentation and theory, such as when presenting data on human psychology. Artistic “Artistic” refers to art intended to express human creativity such as painting, drawings, architecture, sculpture, literature, poetry, music, performing, and scripted content. An example would be a video of a poetry recital. Dramatized “Dramatized” refers to scripted content such as movies or fictional settings including animated content. Graphic, Graphicness \"Graphic” or “graphicness” refers to inclusions of explicit and realistic portrayals such as the following: Gore or open wounds resulting from violent acts, like street fights. Violent acts against animals, like kicking. Visuals of sexual acts, sexual body parts and fluids. Realism “Realism” refers to three levels of severity: “Low realism”: Highly divergent from reality, such as a talking cat. “Moderate realism”: Low divergence from reality, such as exaggerated graphics depicting real-world figures such as humans or animated characters in video games. “High realism”: Real-world situations depicting humans as main characters, such as a street fight.

Focus, Focal “Focus” or “focal” refers to when a segment or full video is about a given topic, and that there is repeated reference and focus on the topic. A passing reference to one of the topics listed as controversial or sensitive is not a reason for No Ads. For example, briefly acknowledging a controversial or sensitive topic (e.g. “In next week’s video we’ll be discussing declining rates of suicide.”) wouldn’t be considered focal, but a segment of a video specifically talking about such a topic would be considered focal. Focus need not be verbal. If there is an image or text that focuses on the sensitive issue, that would be considered focus too. Some examples include: A video focused on how to perform self-harm. Content only focused on using strong profanities without other context or reason. Fleeting “Fleeting” refers to moments that are not the focus of content (not focal), and include passing references to topics listed as controversial or sensitive. For example, briefly acknowledging a controversial or sensitive topic (e.g. “In next week’s video we’ll be discussing declining rates of suicide.”) wouldn’t be considered focal, but rather fleeting. Sensational Refers to a manner intended to arouse curiosity or broad interest, especially through the inclusion of exaggerated, graphic, or sensitive details. “Sensational eating,” such as eating animal or animal parts that are alive or still visibly moving. “Sensational preparation or eating” where preparation or eating becomes theatrical, such as part of “mukbang” or an ASMR performance. “Sensational depiction of controversial issues” where sensitive topics, like bullying, become the core theme of entertainment, particularly through negative character interactions.

YouTube Kids advertising policies may evolve over time. We encourage you to check back often to read the latest updates. All YouTube Kids Paid Ads must be pre-approved by YouTube’s policy team prior to being served in the YouTube Kids app. Additionally, advertisers must also comply with applicable laws and regulations (including any relevant self-regulatory or industry guidelines). You can read more about our ad format requirements below. What is a Paid Ad in YouTube Kids? To provide an experience free of charge, YouTube Kids is ad-supported with limited advertising. When you select a YouTube video in the app, you may see an ad bumper followed by a video ad- marked with an \"Ad\" disclaimer- before the video you selected. These are paid advertisements (\"Paid Ads\"). Videos uploaded by users to YouTube are not Paid Ads and therefore they are not marked as an Ad nor are they subject to our advertising policies. This may also include content about or from companies who may have also purchased Ads in the app. For example, a search for trains could result in train cartoons, songs and videos of real trains uploaded by a user or a toy train company, none of which we consider as Paid Ads, as they are not part of the YouTube Kids advertising program. Likewise, a search for chocolate can show a user-uploaded video on making chocolate fudge even though we do not allow paid Ads for chocolatiers. Learn more about Videos on YouTube Kids. Ad Format Requirements Format: At this time we only accept the in-stream video ad format in YouTube Kids. Maximum time length: 15-20 seconds long for non-skippable (depending on where the viewer is based) and 60 seconds for skippable (length may vary based on market).

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users should visit the Display & Video 360 help center for details about the advertiser verification program for Display & Video 360. Build trust, increase transparency, and get access to more features by completing advertiser verification. You’ll just need to complete a few tasks, such as answering a few questions about your organization. After getting verified, some of your info will appear in ad disclosures and the Ads Transparency Center, which provides context about an advertiser and their ads. Google will require you to complete one or more tasks as part of advertiser verification. Google Ads will notify you via an in-account notification or an email when you need to complete advertiser verification and what your deadline will be. When your account is selected for verification, some of your ads may be restricted. To resolve these issues and ensure your other ads continue to run, you’ll need to complete advertiser verification by the required timeline. In this article Advertiser verification Timelines for verification Tasks required for verification Document requirements for advertiser verification Issues with submitting documents Issues with answering questions about your business operations Change name or ownership Ads transparency Advertiser verification As a part of a gradual rollout of Google’s transparency efforts, all advertisers will eventually be required to complete advertiser verification. Why was I selected for advertiser verification? Here are some reasons why you may have been selected: Your account is part of Google’s transparency efforts, where all advertisers will eventually complete advertiser verification Your advertising behavior or your ad content was labeled as potentially suspicious You’re running ads for certain industries, like financial services You’re running ads on brand-related queries You’re using features that are often misused Your account was suspended and, to submit an appeal, you need to complete verification. In this case, your account will remain suspended until your appeal is granted. In some cases, Google Ads will pause your account until you complete advertiser verification. This could happen for a few reasons: Google Ads suspects that your ads violated Ads policies. This includes: Misleading representation Unreliable claims Unidentified business Business name requirements Solicitation of funds Sensitive events Coordinated deceptive practices Google Ads suspects that your advertising or business practices may cause physical or monetary harm. This includes: Misrepresenting yourself in your ad content Offering financial products or services under false pretenses Offering unauthorized customer support services on behalf of third parties Google Ads suspects that you’re trying to circumvent advertiser verification Google Ads couldn’t verify your information or your advertising behavior To determine if an account needs to be paused during verification, Google may review information from multiple sources, including: regulatory warnings, rulings about an advertiser’s business practices or complaints from people using Google, businesses, and other entities about impersonation or scams. How will my information be used?

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Personalized advertising is a powerful tool that improves advertising relevance for users and increases ROI for advertisers. Because it works by employing online user data to target users with more relevant advertising content, it can provide an improved experience for users and advertisers alike. When employing user behavior or interest data to provide more relevant ad content it’s important to handle that information appropriately. We recognize that certain interests are sensitive and that targeting based on them could negatively impact user experience. With this in mind and based on the sensitivities associated with user ad targeting, we’ve identified policy standards for all personalized advertising targeting features. For the purposes of this article, targeting means both positive and negative targeting. These standards do not replace our other advertising policies (for example, for Google Ads or Shopping) and advertisers are still responsible for complying with all applicable advertising policies, in addition to Personalized advertising policies. Advertisers are also required to comply with our policies for European Union user consent, where applicable. Google's privacy policy applies to all Google features and dictates how Google collects, uses, and protects user data. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. In this article Personalized advertising content policy principles Restrictions based on personalized advertising targeting feature Sensitive interest categories Legal restrictions: restricted drug terms, clinical trial recruitment, alcohol, gambling, location-based gambling Personal hardships: health, negative financial status, relationship hardships, commission of a crime, abuse and trauma, imposing negativity Identity and belief: sexual orientation, political affiliation, political content, trade union membership, race and ethnicity, religious belief, marginalized groups, transgender identification Sexual interests: birth control, sexual content Limited Personalization Access to opportunities (US/CA): housing, employment, consumer finance Options to fix: Access to opportunities Personalized advertising data collection and use policies Options to fix ad violations Personalized advertising content policy principles Sensitive interest categories are restricted in personalized ads. We define sensitive interest categories in terms of the following content policy principles: Legal restrictions: Ads must comply with the law. Personal hardships: Ads shouldn’t target users in ways that exploit their difficulties or struggles. Identity and belief: Ads shouldn’t target users based on categories prone to systemic discrimination or unfair stigmas. Sexual interests: Ads shouldn’t target users based on inherently private sexual interests or experiences. Access to opportunities: Ads shouldn’t limit access to opportunities by leveraging unfair societal biases when targeting users with specific content categories. Restrictions based on personalized advertising targeting feature For purposes of this policy, personalized ads policies may apply differently depending on the targeting feature used. For all targeting features, there are two components: Targeting users, which refers to the groups of users you've chosen to see your ads or exclude from seeing your ads. Targeting, both positive and negative, includes all aspects of creating or selecting those groups. Promoting products and services, which refers to the specific content in your ad or on your landing page. The type of personalization available depends, in part, on whether the products and services you are promoting are sensitive. For all personalized ads targeting features, we don’t allow targeting users based on sensitive interest categories. For advertiser-curated audiences, where advertisers can customize, curate, or upload their own audiences, advertisers are also not allowed to promote products and services from sensitive interest categories. For pre-defined Google audiences, where Google manages the development and curation of policy-compliant audiences based on information across Google properties, advertisers are allowed to promote products and services from sensitive interest categories. Effect of the policy: Audiences for personalized ads Advertisers promoting products and services that fall within sensitive interest categories are unable to use advertiser-curated audiences. This helps ensure that sensitive interest categories aren’t inadvertently used for targeting audiences. Because predefined Google audiences are expressly configured without sensitive user signals, all advertisers are allowed to use them, even if they promote sensitive interest categories. See the following non-exhaustive list of targeting features and how personalized ads policies apply. Advertiser-curated audiences If you’re an advertiser that promotes products and services in sensitive interest categories you cannot use the following targeting features. Predefined Google audiences Advertisers are able to use the following targeting features, including advertisers that promote products and services in sensitive interest categories. Customer Match Your data segments Audience Expansion Lookalike Segments Custom segments Custom Affinity In-market Segment Affinity Demographics (with exceptions)1 Detailed Demographics (with exceptions)1 Life Events Location Targeting2 1: Certain demographics (age, gender, marital status, parental status) may not be used to target Housing, Employment, and Consumer Finance Ads in the United States and Canada. 2: ZIP code location targeting can not be used for Housing, Employment, and Consumer Finance Ads in the United States and Canada. 3: Users under the age of 18 are not eligible for personalized advertising of any kind, including serving based on Predefined Google Audiences. Advertisers using advertiser-curated audiences are prohibited from uploading customer information from viewers of child-directed content. To ensure that we provide a high-quality consumer ad experience on Google’s personalized feeds, Demand Gen ads must comply with all Google Ads and personalization policies. Ads in sensitive categories may be fully or partially blocked from serving on Demand Gen's surfaces. Sensitive interest categories Legal restrictions Ads must comply with all applicable laws and regulations for all of the locations where your ads are showing. We don’t allow targeting users based on legally restricted content, as defined in the following sensitive interest categories. Depending on the targeting feature used, you also may not be allowed to promote products and services in the following sensitive interest categories. You are responsible for ensuring your ads comply with policy where required. See below for specific examples of what we don't allow. Restricted drug terms in personalized advertising Prescription medications and information about prescription medications, unless the medication and any listed ingredients are only intended for animal use and are not prone to human abuse or other misuse. Content directed to healthcare professionals in their professional medical capacity is excluded from this restriction for advertisers in the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Advertisers that are planning to use Google’s personalized targeting tools to promote products or services containing Restricted Drug Terms to healthcare professionals in their professional medical capacity after July 1, 2025, must apply for the Restricted Drug Term Personalization Certification. Clinical trial recruitment in personalized advertising Promotion of clinical trial recruitment Alcohol in personalized advertising Alcoholic beverages and drinks that resemble alcoholic beverages Gambling in personalized advertising Sensitive: No personalization allowed Not sensitive: Personalization allowed Gambling, including online and offline gambling Online gambling-related information Online non-casino games played for money or prizes Online casino-based games, regardless of whether money is exchanged Globally: Google App campaigns promoting social casino gaming apps to app users In India: Google App campaigns promoting apps for the games of skill of Daily Fantasy Sports and Rummy to app users Location-based gambling in personalized advertising Physical casinos that explicitly promote gambling Learn more about how to Fix ads with policy violations. Personal hardships We understand that users don’t want to see ads that exploit their personal struggles, difficulties, and hardships, so we don’t allow personalized advertising based on these hardships. Such personal hardships include health conditions, treatments, procedures, personal failings, struggles, or traumatic personal experiences. You also can’t impose negativity on the user. We don’t allow targeting users based on personal hardships, as defined in the following sensitive interest categories. Depending on the targeting feature used, you also may not be allowed to promote products and services in the following sensitive interest categories. You are responsible for ensuring your ads comply with policy where required. See below for specific examples of what we don't allow. Health in personalized advertising Personal health content, which includes: Physical or mental health conditions, including diseases, sexual health, and chronic health conditions, which are health conditions that require long-term care or management Products, services, or procedures to treat or manage chronic health conditions, which includes over-the-counter medications and medical devices Any health issues associated with intimate body parts or functions, which includes genital, bowel, or urinary health Invasive medical procedures, which includes cosmetic surgery, surgical procedures, or injections Disabilities, even when content is oriented toward the user’s primary caretaker Examples (non-exhaustive): Treatments for chronic health conditions like diabetes or arthritis, treatments for sexually transmitted diseases, counseling services for mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and addiction, medical devices for sleep apnea like CPAP machines, over-the-counter medications for yeast infections, treatments for pregnancy and infertility, information about how to support your autistic child Personal health content excludes content directed to healthcare professionals in their professional medical capacity, such as promoting atorvastatin or orthopedic implants to healthcare professionals in their professional medical capacity.

Identity and belief We consider identity and belief systems to be deeply personal and complex. They’re highly dependent on diversity of cultural norms, geography, history, and personal life experiences. We also understand that how one identifies or what one believes can be used to segment users based on judgments or stigmas. We want ads to provide a positive experience and to be informed by users’ interests rather than by who they’re perceived to be as a person, so we don’t allow personalized advertising based on a user’s fundamental or intrinsic self-identity or their belief systems. Such identities and beliefs can include inherently private classifications of one’s self; classifications susceptible to stigmas, discrimination, or harassment; membership within groups that are susceptible to stigmas, discrimination, or prejudices; and personally held belief systems. We don’t allow targeting users based on identity and belief, as outlined in the following sensitive interest categories. Depending on the targeting feature used, you also may not be allowed to promote products and services in the following sensitive interest categories. You are responsible for ensuring your ads comply with policy where required. See below for specific examples of what we don't allow.

Sexual interests We understand that sexual interests are inherently private and, depending on cultural norms, not often candidly discussed. We believe in maintaining the privacy of a user’s sexual interests, so we don’t allow personalized advertising that targets users based on their personal sexual interests, experiences, activities, or preferences. Such interests include sexual behaviors, activities, or products used when having sex. Additionally, we don’t allow categories that are sexually suggestive or intended to sexually arouse. We don’t allow targeting users based on sexual interests, as outlined in the following sensitive interest categories. Depending on the targeting feature used, you also may not be allowed to promote products and services in the following sensitive interest categories. You are responsible for ensuring your ads comply with policy where required. See below for specific examples of what we don't allow. Birth control in personalized advertising Devices intended to prevent pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases Examples (non-exhaustive): condoms, oral contraceptive pill, contraceptive sponge Sexual content All sexual content as defined in the Google Ads Sexual content policy. If the Sexual content policy and the Personalized advertising sexual interests policy differ on how each treats a category, the Personalized advertising sexual interests policy takes precedence over the Sexual content policy with respect to how the category can be used for targeting and personalized ads. Learn more about how to Fix ads with policy violations. Limited personalization Access to opportunities We believe access to social and economic opportunities is fundamental for individual well-being, social status and quality of life. We also recognize that historic discrimination and societal biases have resulted in some segments of society having unequal access to these opportunities. Therefore, in an effort to improve inclusivity for users disproportionately affected by society’s biases, we don’t allow some categories of products or services to be targeted to specific audiences. This is in addition to existing ads policies that prohibit discrimination and personalized ads policies that prohibit use of Identity and Belief categories. See below for specific examples of what we don't allow. Countries: United States, Canada The following criteria may not be used to target Housing, Employment, and Consumer Finance Ads in the United States and Canada: Gender, age, parental status, marital status targeting (all options must be set to “Enable”) ZIP Code targeting Housing in personalized ads Homes for sale or rental, where a home is defined as a place a person would reside.

Personalized advertising data collection and use policies These policies define requirements for data collection and use in personalized ads. They apply in addition to the Google ads policies for data collection and use. You aren't allowed to do the following: Run ads that collect or contain personally identifiable information (PII), unless using an ad format provided by Google and designed for that purpose Examples (non-exhaustive): Collecting email addresses, telephone numbers, or credit card numbers within the ad itself Use PII in connection with any anonymous or pseudonymous data, including in remarketing lists, cookies, or data feeds. Share PII with Google through remarketing tags or any product data feeds that might be associated with ads Send Google precise location information without first obtaining users' consent Use a remarketing list that targets an overly narrow or specific audience. This includes the case where combining a remarketing list with other targeting criteria (such as geographic limitations or other user segmentation) results in an ad targeted to a relatively small number of users. Learn more about remarketing list size requirements. For Remarketing You can choose to disable the collection of remarketing data for users who do not wish to view personalized ads by using the parameter: allow_ad_personalization_signals.

        "content": "Personalized advertising Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Personalized advertising is a powerful tool that improves advertising relevance for users and increases ROI for advertisers. Because it works by employing online user data to target users with more relevant advertising content, it can provide an improved experience for users and advertisers alike. When employing user behavior or interest data to provide more relevant ad content it’s important to handle that information appropriately. We recognize that certain interests are sensitive and that targeting based on them could negatively impact user experience. With this in mind and based on the sensitivities associated with user ad targeting, we’ve identified policy standards for all personalized advertising targeting features. For the purposes of this article, targeting means both positive and negative targeting. These standards do not replace our other advertising policies (for example, for Google Ads or Shopping) and advertisers are still responsible for complying with all applicable advertising policies, in addition to Personalized advertising policies. Advertisers are also required to comply with our policies for European Union user consent, where applicable. Google's privacy policy applies to all Google features and dictates how Google collects, uses, and protects user data. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. In this article Personalized advertising content policy principles Restrictions based on personalized advertising targeting feature Sensitive interest categories Legal restrictions: restricted drug terms, clinical trial recruitment, alcohol, gambling, location-based gambling Personal hardships: health, negative financial status, relationship hardships, commission of a crime, abuse and trauma, imposing negativity Identity and belief: sexual orientation, political affiliation, political content, trade union membership, race and ethnicity, religious belief, marginalized groups, transgender identification Sexual interests: birth control, sexual content Limited Personalization Access to opportunities (US/CA): housing, employment, consumer finance Options to fix: Access to opportunities Personalized advertising data collection and use policies Options to fix ad violations Personalized advertising content policy principles Sensitive interest categories are restricted in personalized ads. We define sensitive interest categories in terms of the following content policy principles: Legal restrictions: Ads must comply with the law. Personal hardships: Ads shouldn’t target users in ways that exploit their difficulties or struggles. Identity and belief: Ads shouldn’t target users based on categories prone to systemic discrimination or unfair stigmas. Sexual interests: Ads shouldn’t target users based on inherently private sexual interests or experiences. Access to opportunities: Ads shouldn’t limit access to opportunities by leveraging unfair societal biases when targeting users with specific content categories. Restrictions based on personalized advertising targeting feature For purposes of this policy, personalized ads policies may apply differently depending on the targeting feature used. For all targeting features, there are two components: Targeting users, which refers to the groups of users you've chosen to see your ads or exclude from seeing your ads. Targeting, both positive and negative, includes all aspects of creating or selecting those groups. Promoting products and services, which refers to the specific content in your ad or on your landing page. The type of personalization available depends, in part, on whether the products and services you are promoting are sensitive. For all personalized ads targeting features, we don’t allow targeting users based on sensitive interest categories. For advertiser-curated audiences, where advertisers can customize, curate, or upload their own audiences, advertisers are also not allowed to promote products and services from sensitive interest categories. For pre-defined Google audiences, where Google manages the development and curation of policy-compliant audiences based on information across Google properties, advertisers are allowed to promote products and services from sensitive interest categories. Effect of the policy: Audiences for personalized ads Advertisers promoting products and services that fall within sensitive interest categories are unable to use advertiser-curated audiences. This helps ensure that sensitive interest categories aren’t inadvertently used for targeting audiences. Because predefined Google audiences are expressly configured without sensitive user signals, all advertisers are allowed to use them, even if they promote sensitive interest categories. See the following non-exhaustive list of targeting features and how personalized ads policies apply. Advertiser-curated audiences If you’re an advertiser that promotes products and services in sensitive interest categories you cannot use the following targeting features. Predefined Google audiences Advertisers are able to use the following targeting features, including advertisers that promote products and services in sensitive interest categories. Customer Match Your data segments Audience Expansion Lookalike Segments Custom segments Custom Affinity In-market Segment Affinity Demographics (with exceptions)1 Detailed Demographics (with exceptions)1 Life Events Location Targeting2 1: Certain demographics (age, gender, marital status, parental status) may not be used to target Housing, Employment, and Consumer Finance Ads in the United States and Canada. 2: ZIP code location targeting can not be used for Housing, Employment, and Consumer Finance Ads in the United States and Canada. 3: Users under the age of 18 are not eligible for personalized advertising of any kind, including serving based on Predefined Google Audiences. Advertisers using advertiser-curated audiences are prohibited from uploading customer information from viewers of child-directed content. To ensure that we provide a high-quality consumer ad experience on Google’s personalized feeds, Demand Gen ads must comply with all Google Ads and personalization policies. Ads in sensitive categories may be fully or partially blocked from serving on Demand Gen's surfaces. Sensitive interest categories Legal restrictions Ads must comply with all applicable laws and regulations for all of the locations where your ads are showing. We don’t allow targeting users based on legally restricted content, as defined in the following sensitive interest categories. Depending on the targeting feature used, you also may not be allowed to promote products and services in the following sensitive interest categories. You are responsible for ensuring your ads comply with policy where required. See below for specific examples of what we don't allow. Restricted drug terms in personalized advertising Prescription medications and information about prescription medications, unless the medication and any listed ingredients are only intended for animal use and are not prone to human abuse or other misuse. Content directed to healthcare professionals in their professional medical capacity is excluded from this restriction for advertisers in the United States, Canada and New Zealand. Advertisers that are planning to use Google’s personalized targeting tools to promote products or services containing Restricted Drug Terms to healthcare professionals in their professional medical capacity after July 1, 2025, must apply for the Restricted Drug Term Personalization Certification. Clinical trial recruitment in personalized advertising Promotion of clinical trial recruitment Alcohol in personalized advertising Alcoholic beverages and drinks that resemble alcoholic beverages Gambling in personalized advertising Sensitive: No personalization allowed Not sensitive: Personalization allowed Gambling, including online and offline gambling Online gambling-related information Online non-casino games played for money or prizes Online casino-based games, regardless of whether money is exchanged Globally: Google App campaigns promoting social casino gaming apps to app users In India: Google App campaigns promoting apps for the games of skill of Daily Fantasy Sports and Rummy to app users Location-based gambling in personalized advertising Physical casinos that explicitly promote gambling Learn more about how to Fix ads with policy violations. Personal hardships We understand that users don’t want to see ads that exploit their personal struggles, difficulties, and hardships, so we don’t allow personalized advertising based on these hardships. Such personal hardships include health conditions, treatments, procedures, personal failings, struggles, or traumatic personal experiences. You also can’t impose negativity on the user. We don’t allow targeting users based on personal hardships, as defined in the following sensitive interest categories. Depending on the targeting feature used, you also may not be allowed to promote products and services in the following sensitive interest categories. You are responsible for ensuring your ads comply with policy where required. See below for specific examples of what we don't allow. Health in personalized advertising Personal health content, which includes: Physical or mental health conditions, including diseases, sexual health, and chronic health conditions, which are health conditions that require long-term care or management Products, services, or procedures to treat or manage chronic health conditions, which includes over-the-counter medications and medical devices Any health issues associated with intimate body parts or functions, which includes genital, bowel, or urinary health Invasive medical procedures, which includes cosmetic surgery, surgical procedures, or injections Disabilities, even when content is oriented toward the user’s primary caretaker Examples (non-exhaustive): Treatments for chronic health conditions like diabetes or arthritis, treatments for sexually transmitted diseases, counseling services for mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and addiction, medical devices for sleep apnea like CPAP machines, over-the-counter medications for yeast infections, treatments for pregnancy and infertility, information about how to support your autistic child Personal health content excludes content directed to healthcare professionals in their professional medical capacity, such as promoting atorvastatin or orthopedic implants to healthcare professionals in their professional medical capacity.

Identity and belief We consider identity and belief systems to be deeply personal and complex. They’re highly dependent on diversity of cultural norms, geography, history, and personal life experiences. We also understand that how one identifies or what one believes can be used to segment users based on judgments or stigmas. We want ads to provide a positive experience and to be informed by users’ interests rather than by who they’re perceived to be as a person, so we don’t allow personalized advertising based on a user’s fundamental or intrinsic self-identity or their belief systems. Such identities and beliefs can include inherently private classifications of one’s self; classifications susceptible to stigmas, discrimination, or harassment; membership within groups that are susceptible to stigmas, discrimination, or prejudices; and personally held belief systems. We don’t allow targeting users based on identity and belief, as outlined in the following sensitive interest categories. Depending on the targeting feature used, you also may not be allowed to promote products and services in the following sensitive interest categories. You are responsible for ensuring your ads comply with policy where required. See below for specific examples of what we don't allow.

Performance Max is a goal-based campaign type that allows performance advertisers to access all of their Google Ads inventory from a single campaign. It's designed to complement your keyword-based Search campaigns to help you find more converting customers across all of Google's channels like YouTube, Display, Search, Discover, Gmail, and Maps. Performance Max helps you drive performance based on your specified conversion goals, delivering more conversions and value by optimizing performance in real-time and across channels using Smart Bidding. Performance Max uses Google AI across bidding, budget optimization, audiences, creatives, attribution, and more. They're all empowered by your specific advertising objective, for example, if you have a CPA or ROAS target, and the creative assets, audience signals, and optional data feeds you provide. Note: If you’re using Performance Max through Google Ad Grants, your campaign may not be eligible to serve on all inventory. New channels and inventory will come over time to help you drive results across all of Google. Note: Performance Max will show as a campaign type selection if your advertising objective is “Sales”, “Leads”, or “Local store visits and promotions”. On this page Benefits When to use it Google AI Campaign inputs Benefits Find more converting customers You customize the goals that matter to your business and maximize conversions or conversion value.

Google AI is used to make more accurate predictions about which ads, audiences, and creative combinations perform best for you. Acquire rich insights Performance Max asset reporting can help you understand which creatives are impacting performance and help you optimize campaign creatives to drive ROI. New insights, such as rising search trends, can help you understand changes in performance and inform your broader business strategy. When to use it Performance Max is the best option to use when: You have specific advertising and conversion goals. For example, driving online sales, lead generation, and others. You want to maximize the performance of your campaign, and you aren't limited by which channel your ads appear on. You want to easily access all of Google’s advertising channels using a single campaign. You want to gain additional reach and conversion value beyond keyword-based Search campaigns. Google AI Note: Text customization was formerly known as automatically created assets. Google AI powers Performance Max to maximize your campaign’s performance. You add your unique expertise such as budget, business goals, and conversions that you want to measure. Google AI will then find potential customers for your goals and serve the most appropriate ad, with the optimal bid, to maximize campaign performance. Smart Bidding combined with attribution technology helps to determine the best options for your campaign across all Google inventory and to determine bids on the auctions that have the highest probability of meeting your business goals in real-time.

These assets will appear in campaign-level settings as accounts are added to the beta. Learn more About text customization in Performance Max campaigns.

These assets will appear in campaign-level settings. Learn more About video assets for Performance Max campaigns. Note: Performance Max campaigns that use auto-generated videos may show customers who visit your landing page a different product than the one featured in your video. This difference may be caused when the product linked in your Final URL doesn’t match the product in your campaign videos. If you’d like to restrict the landing page and ensure that the product a customer clicks is the product that they viewed, limit the products shown in your asset groups to the most relevant landing page using product filters. Campaign inputs Performance Max uses Google AI to optimize bids and placements to drive conversions or conversion value for your goals, but you can provide important inputs like audience signals, including your customer data, and high quality text, images, and video that can significantly improve your campaign performance. You can also provide important inputs about what types of conversions are most valuable to your business by applying conversion values and setting value rules. Account-level brand safety settings are also available so you can tell Google Ads about the types of content where you don’t want your ads to appear. How Performance Max works with Search campaigns and keywords Performance Max complements existing Search campaigns and respects your keyword targeting. If the user’s query is identical to an exact match keyword in your Search campaign, the Search campaign will be prioritized over Performance Max. Search themes have the same prioritization as phrase match and broad match keywords. Learn more About keyword prioritization within a Google Ads account. Your Performance Max campaign may sometimes show for branded keywords in your Search campaign, even if those keywords are set to exact match (for example, if your Search campaign is limited by budget or if the targeting is stricter). If this happens and you want to prevent this overlap, you can use brand exclusions within Performance Max or add those keywords as negative keywords in your Performance Max campaign.

        "content": "Multiply conversions with Performance MaxBest practices for creating and optimizing Performance Max campaigns Performance Max campaigns allow advertisers to get the full power of Google’s channels and AI, all in one campaign to maximize performance. Performance Max drives the strongest performance and ROAS across all of Google’s channels. It automatically uses the full power of Google AI from end-to-end to improve your bidding, audiences, creative, and more. From a single, easy-to-use campaign, capture valuable searches and multiply conversions from customers you might have missed. Most retailers advertising with Google are already using Performance Max and seeing great results. Beyond retail, advertisers who adopt Performance Max see an average increase of 27% more conversions or value at a similar CPA/ROAS. This is even when they already use broad match and Smart Bidding in their Search campaigns.1 On this page For all advertisers and goal types Goal-specific best practices Evaluating your performance For all advertisers and goal types: Pick conversion goals that matter to your business. In general, choose the same conversion goals as your other existing performance campaigns (like Search campaigns). This helps you stay consistent in what you’re optimizing for, and helps our bidding systems better optimize toward the same goal across campaigns. Setting up a new customer acquisition goal allows you to value and prioritize bidding for new customers, while still maximizing sales from existing ones. You can also choose to focus exclusively on new customers. We strongly recommend using New Customer Value Mode if you want to grow overall online sales while also growing your new customer base. Advertisers who highly value new customer acquisitions and use New Customer Value Mode improved their ROAS by 9%, improved their new customer ratio by 5%, and reduced acquisition cost for new customers by 7%.2 Setting up a retention goal allows you to bid more for lapsed customers. You’ll also be able to specify which customers have higher lifetime value, so Performance Max can prioritize bidding on your most valuable lapsed customers. Set up accurate conversion measurement that reflects what conversions are truly worth to your business. Conversion goals and actions will directly guide Google AI to deliver results against those goals. Set conversion values to represent the relative importance and value of different conversions to your business. By assigning higher values to more important conversions, the campaign can automatically prioritize those to help you maximize value from your budget. Use conversion value rules to further customize how you optimize performance. Adjust conversion values and apply a multiplication factor for higher-value audiences, devices, or geographic locations. Choose the right bidding strategy. Use value-based bidding if you’re tracking values with your conversions. Select “Maximize conversion value” as your bid strategy to drive as much conversion value as possible within your budget. If you have specific ROI goals, you can also add a ROAS target. If you can’t use value-based bidding because you’re not tracking values and care about all your conversions equally, use “Maximize conversions” to drive as many conversions as possible within your budget. You can also add a CPA target. If you’re unsure of which ROAS or CPA target is right for your Performance Max campaign, you can use the targets that you have set for your other performance campaigns (like Search campaigns) as a reference point. Once the campaign has ramped up and gotten more traffic, you can adjust your target up or down accordingly. Keep text customization and Final URL expansion on. Text customization (enabled by default) allow your Performance Max campaign to use content from your landing pages and automatically generate new and additional text assets for your Search ads. This helps you build more assets to better match customers’ unique context and intent, while staying true to your business and offerings. It also helps keep your text assets fresh over time. If you have text customization enabled, you should also use the Final URL expansion feature, which is turned on by default) This helps you find more converting search queries that are likely to perform well based on customers’ intent and their relevance to your landing pages. This feature will enable your ads to show up on additional searches that have a strong likelihood of leading to conversions. Final URL Expansion uses landing pages on your website to match your ads to more relevant queries. Advertisers who use Final URL expansion with Performance Max campaigns see an average increase of over 9% in conversions/conversion value at a similar Cost Per Action (CPA)/Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).3 Exclude specific parts of your website from being targeted with the final URL Exclusion feature, as needed. For example, exclude your company blog or FAQ pages if these aren’t meant to drive conversions. If you have text customization enabled and there is a specific category of web pages on your website you would like to target, you can use “URL contains” rules to target traffic based on those categories. This rule targets all webpages that have a URL containing specific text. For instance, you can target your campaign specifically to all web pages that have “dogfood” in the URL. When final URL expansion is ON, these rules help inform and guide Google AI to understand these categories are important (but does not restrict its matching to them). With final URL expansion OFF, “URL contains” rules restrict matching to pages within those categories. Add page feeds to Performance Max to further refine your results from Search inventory. When final URL expansion is ON, this additional feed helps inform and guide Google AI to understand that these URLs are important (but does not restrict its matching to them). With final URL expansion OFF, page feeds make it easier to add more specific URLs to your Performance Max campaign at scale and to restrict matching to just these URLs. Page feeds also require text customization to be enabled. Goal Action Get additional conversions from search queries that are likely to perform well and maximize reach. Leave Final URL expansion ON. Find additional search queries that are likely to perform well and maximize reach, but exclude some landing pages on your website, such as Careers or FAQ pages that aren’t optimized to drive conversions. You can also exclude entire categories of your site that you don't want to present in your ads (for example, if you’re discontinuing a brand and no longer want to advertise it). Use URL Exclusions or URL parameter rules while leaving Final URL expansion ON. Find additional search queries, but exclude certain ones you don’t want to appear on even if they perform well, for example, due to your corporate guidelines. Use account-level negative keywords or campaign-level negative keywords while leaving Final URL expansion ON. Find additional search queries, but exclude certain branded terms you don’t want to appear on, for example, due to local regulations. Use campaign-level brand exclusions while leaving Final URL expansion ON. Get traffic only for a specific category of pages you want to drive conversions from, even if other categories could also drive performance. For example, you might have a dedicated budget for “running shoes” that can’t be used to sell “basketball shoes”. Turn Final URL expansion OFF and use “URL contains” rules to target a specific category of web pages. Your web pages should be structured around a type of categorization for this feature to work effectively. (For example, www.domain.com/brand, www.domain.com/brand/category1, www.domain.com/brand/category2.) Get traffic only for a set of specific pages you want to drive conversions from, even if other pages for the same category could also drive performance. For example, your legal team may need to approve the use of every landing page used in advertising. Turn Final URL expansion OFF and use page feeds to restrict matching to those specific URLs. I don't want to drive additional conversions from other landing pages on my website. I'm only able to send customers to a single landing page (e.g. due to policy reasons) and it's the only path to conversion. Turn Final URL expansion OFF (not recommended). Note Monitor how exclusions impact your reach and performance to make sure you’re not missing out on valuable conversion opportunities. Learn more about Final URL expansion. Maximize the variety of your creative assets to engage consumers more effectively. Create asset groups related to a single theme. You can create multiple asset groups per campaign if needed, and each asset group should relate to a unified theme (like a product or service category). Add as many versions of text, image, and video assets as possible (including different image sizes). This helps you reach consumers in more relevant ways depending on their context and mindset, and allows you to promote your business in more places. The more assets you provide, the more ad formats the campaign can create, and the more inventory your ads can appear on. Use Ad Strength to help you understand if you have the optimal asset mix, where you can improve, and to ensure you can run on all available inventory. Make sure your text assets differ meaningfully from each other and make sense when combined together. Use authentic, high-quality images that inspire people to engage with your brand. We also provide free stock images during campaign construction. Include a video asset that’s at least 10 seconds long. Based on internal data, advertisers that included at least one video in their Performance Max campaigns saw an average increase of 12% total additional conversions.4 This is from advertisers uploading their own video or having Google AI auto-generate one for them. If you don’t have a video, Performance Max will automatically generate one for you using your other assets. You can also easily create your own video using the video creation tool in the asset library. You can access the tool during campaign creation or after, in the Assets section. Upload videos in different orientations. Based on internal data, advertisers that included at least one video of each orientation (horizontal, vertical, and square) to their Performance Max Campaigns delivered 20% more conversions in YouTube compared to horizontal videos alone.5 Utilize Performance Max’s asset generation capabilities to create new assets, including text and images, at scale with the power of generative AI (US only). When creating a new Performance Max campaign or asset group, enter your URL and click “Generate assets” in the asset generation step to get suggested headlines, descriptions, and images automatically. You can combine your creativity with Google AI to easily create new text and image assets. Use text prompts to provide details on the types of assets you would like to generate. When generating images, make the prompt as clear as possible when describing the image you want and be specific about what you’d like to generate. You can provide details about an item, the background, the lighting, specific colors, and more. You can even indicate the type of image style you’d like, such as something that’s photo-realistic or an illustrated representation. While you can generate a variety of images in different styles, we recommend using this feature to generate lifestyle imagery, or generic product imagery if you sell many products. Once you’ve generated your assets, you can select the ones you’d like to serve in the campaign. You can even steer Google AI by asking it to generate more assets similar to ones you've just made. Use additional assets like sitelinks, callouts, lead forms, and phone calls to help your ads show up more prominently and provide extra details to your customers—including different ways they can contact you. Learn more about how asset groups work. Steer Google AI with audience signals and search themes. Audience signals provide inputs to help your campaign ramp up and optimize performance faster. Input audience signals to guide Google AI and include lower-funnel audience segments, such as your data (which includes Customer Match lists of existing customers who’ve engaged with your business in the past, and website visitors). To use Customer Match, you’ll want to create a customer list, upload it to Google Ads, and update it regularly. Note A major benefit of AI is its ability to help you unlock new converting audience segments—even ones you might not have expected or known about. Performance Max campaigns don’t limit your ads to a selected set of audiences and help you find new, valuable customers. Search themes let you provide inputs about your business, such as queries that you know your customers are looking for. They are additive to what Performance Max would match you to using your URLs, assets, and more. Search themes also help you find audiences across all Google Ads channels based on users’ search behavior. Search themes can be helpful if you have knowledge about your business or customers that AI can’t easily or quickly learn. For example, if your landing page doesn’t have complete details or the latest updates about the products and services you offer, you can use search themes to help fill in the gaps. Search themes have the same prioritization as your phrase match and broad match keywords in your Search campaigns. Exact match keywords that are identical to the search queries are prioritized over search themes and other keywords. Search themes will respect brand exclusions in Performance Max and negative keywords. Results driven from search themes will bring your customers to the landing pages you’ve indicated via your Final URL expansion, page feeds, and URL contains settings. Use experiments to A/B test uplift. There are two types of experiments you can run today: Measure the uplift of adding Performance Max as a complement to your existing campaign mix. Measure the uplift of switching from Standard Shopping campaigns to Performance Max for online sales with a product feed. Goal-specific best practices For online sales with a Merchant Center feed: Check out our guide for retail advertisers. For store goals: Measure local actions, store visits and store sales in Google Ads, and there are multiple ways to upload store data to Google Ads. If you don’t measure store visits or if you'd like a higher volume of offline conversions, use local actions conversions, such as “Get directions” clicks or “Clicks to call”. Set your initial campaign budgets based on the performance goals for your business locations. For your existing campaigns, use Performance Planner to fine tune your budgets and help you maximize seasonal periods, increase campaign efficiency, and incorporate the most up-to-date Google auction data and signals to improve your media planning. You must upload creative assets, including headlines, descriptions, call-to-actions, and a final URL. When creating assets for your store goals campaign, focus on what makes your store unique, like exclusive in-store promotions and showcasing in-store products to get shoppers excited. Additional assets will not appear for Performance Max campaigns with store-only goals. Final URL expansion and page feeds do not apply to campaigns that have store-only goals at this time. Allow for 30 days of data before analyzing results from campaigns with store goals to allow enough time for consumers to visit the business location after engaging with the ad, and for store visit conversions to populate in your reporting. Learn more about store visit conversion windows. Use the per-store report to understand how Performance Max is contributing towards traffic and conversions to each business location. Visits and local actions will also be reported by individual store location. For leads: Ensure the Goal category in your conversion action settings is set up properly to optimize for lead generation goals. You can choose from Contact, Submit lead form, Book appointment, Sign-up, or Request Quote. If you don’t have one of these conversion categories selected and they’re relevant to your business, we recommend selecting one. Focus on lead quality rather than just lead volume by optimizing for qualified or converted leads that are as close to the final sale as possible. You should aim to measure and report on the conversions that truly impact business outcomes. Use dynamic values whenever possible. These values can be uploaded using measurement solutions like the Google tag or enhanced conversions for leads. These let you share information with Google Ads about leads that result in in-store sales or final sales on another channel and better optimize for these valuable business outcomes. Providing this data about which leads actually result in sales helps Performance Max drive higher lead quality across channels. Set your lead generation goals to New Customer Only Mode if you only want to target new customers. This requires adding a Customer Match list to help Google distinguish between new and existing customers. Advertisers that use the New Customer Only mode have improved their new customer ratio by 13% with a reduced acquisition cost for new customers by -19%.6 Learn more about lead gen best practices. For hotel suppliers looking to drive hotel bookings: Performance Max for travel goals is currently recommended for hotel suppliers. All other travel clients, such as online travel agencies that sell hotel or vacation rental bookings, should utilize Performance Max campaigns optimized for online sales. Aim to measure and report on final hotel bookings to provide deeper conversions so your campaign knows what types of conversions are most important for your business. Evaluate performance per property and view property-specific metrics in the Hotels tab. We recommend grouping properties in campaigns based on your KPIs and budgeting. Consolidating your campaign structure helps give Google AI more data to make better optimizations. Reach users with more generic ads that aren’t property-specific by adding an asset group to an existing Performance Max campaign for travel goals that has more general creative assets. This is strongly recommended rather than running multiple Performance Max campaigns alongside your Performance Max for travel goals campaign. Learn more about Performance Max for travel goals and check out our onboarding guide. Evaluating your performance General best practices for evaluating your results. Account for conversion delays to ensure you have a complete picture of performance. For example, if it typically takes 7 days for users to convert after engaging with your ads, do not include the most recent week of data when evaluating performance. This is because your data will still be missing conversions from those 7 days. Check your optimization score to find ways to improve your campaign performance. You can find recommendations to improve your campaign, such as optimizing for new customer acquisition, and easily apply them via the Recommendations tab. The Insights page helps you see what’s influencing performance the most, like your top audiences and search themes. Check your Insights page daily for personalized insights. Insights are refreshed daily and are tailored to you and your business. Consistent monitoring can help you stay on top of changing customer behavior and market conditions.

Note A major benefit of AI is its ability to help you unlock new converting audience segments—even ones you might not have expected or known about. Performance Max campaigns don’t limit your ads to a selected set of audiences and help you find new, valuable customers. Search themes let you provide inputs about your business, such as queries that you know your customers are looking for. They are additive to what Performance Max would match you to using your URLs, assets, and more. Search themes also help you find audiences across all Google Ads channels based on users’ search behavior. Search themes can be helpful if you have knowledge about your business or customers that AI can’t easily or quickly learn. For example, if your landing page doesn’t have complete details or the latest updates about the products and services you offer, you can use search themes to help fill in the gaps. Search themes have the same prioritization as your phrase match and broad match keywords in your Search campaigns. Exact match keywords that are identical to the search queries are prioritized over search themes and other keywords. Search themes will respect brand exclusions in Performance Max and negative keywords. Results driven from search themes will bring your customers to the landing pages you’ve indicated via your Final URL expansion, page feeds, and URL contains settings. Use experiments to A/B test uplift. There are two types of experiments you can run today: Measure the uplift of adding Performance Max as a complement to your existing campaign mix. Measure the uplift of switching from Standard Shopping campaigns to Performance Max for online sales with a product feed. Goal-specific best practices For online sales with a Merchant Center feed: Check out our guide for retail advertisers. For store goals: Measure local actions, store visits and store sales in Google Ads, and there are multiple ways to upload store data to Google Ads. If you don’t measure store visits or if you'd like a higher volume of offline conversions, use local actions conversions, such as “Get directions” clicks or “Clicks to call”. Set your initial campaign budgets based on the performance goals for your business locations. For your existing campaigns, use Performance Planner to fine tune your budgets and help you maximize seasonal periods, increase campaign efficiency, and incorporate the most up-to-date Google auction data and signals to improve your media planning. You must upload creative assets, including headlines, descriptions, call-to-actions, and a final URL. When creating assets for your store goals campaign, focus on what makes your store unique, like exclusive in-store promotions and showcasing in-store products to get shoppers excited. Additional assets will not appear for Performance Max campaigns with store-only goals. Final URL expansion and page feeds do not apply to campaigns that have store-only goals at this time. Allow for 30 days of data before analyzing results from campaigns with store goals to allow enough time for consumers to visit the business location after engaging with the ad, and for store visit conversions to populate in your reporting. Learn more about store visit conversion windows. Use the per-store report to understand how Performance Max is contributing towards traffic and conversions to each business location. Visits and local actions will also be reported by individual store location. For leads: Ensure the Goal category in your conversion action settings is set up properly to optimize for lead generation goals. You can choose from Contact, Submit lead form, Book appointment, Sign-up, or Request Quote. If you don’t have one of these conversion categories selected and they’re relevant to your business, we recommend selecting one. Focus on lead quality rather than just lead volume by optimizing for qualified or converted leads that are as close to the final sale as possible. You should aim to measure and report on the conversions that truly impact business outcomes. Use dynamic values whenever possible. These values can be uploaded using measurement solutions like the Google tag or enhanced conversions for leads. These let you share information with Google Ads about leads that result in in-store sales or final sales on another channel and better optimize for these valuable business outcomes. Providing this data about which leads actually result in sales helps Performance Max drive higher lead quality across channels. Set your lead generation goals to New Customer Only Mode if you only want to target new customers. This requires adding a Customer Match list to help Google distinguish between new and existing customers. Advertisers that use the New Customer Only mode have improved their new customer ratio by 13% with a reduced acquisition cost for new customers by -19%.6 Learn more about lead gen best practices. For hotel suppliers looking to drive hotel bookings: Performance Max for travel goals is currently recommended for hotel suppliers. All other travel clients, such as online travel agencies that sell hotel or vacation rental bookings, should utilize Performance Max campaigns optimized for online sales. Aim to measure and report on final hotel bookings to provide deeper conversions so your campaign knows what types of conversions are most important for your business. Evaluate performance per property and view property-specific metrics in the Hotels tab. We recommend grouping properties in campaigns based on your KPIs and budgeting. Consolidating your campaign structure helps give Google AI more data to make better optimizations. Reach users with more generic ads that aren’t property-specific by adding an asset group to an existing Performance Max campaign for travel goals that has more general creative assets. This is strongly recommended rather than running multiple Performance Max campaigns alongside your Performance Max for travel goals campaign. Learn more about Performance Max for travel goals and check out our onboarding guide. Evaluating your performance General best practices for evaluating your results. Account for conversion delays to ensure you have a complete picture of performance. For example, if it typically takes 7 days for users to convert after engaging with your ads, do not include the most recent week of data when evaluating performance. This is because your data will still be missing conversions from those 7 days. Check your optimization score to find ways to improve your campaign performance. You can find recommendations to improve your campaign, such as optimizing for new customer acquisition, and easily apply them via the Recommendations tab. The Insights page helps you see what’s influencing performance the most, like your top audiences and search themes. Check your Insights page daily for personalized insights. Insights are refreshed daily and are tailored to you and your business. Consistent monitoring can help you stay on top of changing customer behavior and market conditions. Note Insights won’t always be generated for every account and campaign at all times. Learn more about why you might not see Insights. To learn about the various reports and Insights you can use to dive deeper into your performance, including channel performance reporting, check out our best practices guide on evaluating your Performance Max results.

        "content": "Retailer best practices for AI-powered Performance Max campaigns Who is this guide for? We’ve created these best practices for retail marketers who are running Performance Max campaigns with a Google Merchant Center feed. If your goal is to increase sales and reach new customers, these guidelines will help you get there. Consumers have never had more options—more ways to get inspired, to research, or to buy. During the 2022 holiday season, 55% of shoppers used five or more channels, ranging from video to social media, to shop over a two-day period.1 AI enables businesses to respond to dynamic shifts in consumer demand in real time, and to present valuable customers with the most relevant ads possible as they toggle among channels. For a growing number of retail marketers, Performance Max has become a critical solution to meet customers wherever they're shopping. Powered by Google AI, Performance Max helps retailers increase sales and optimize ROI across all Google Ads channels and inventory—including Search, YouTube, Display, Discover, and Google Maps. With Performance Max, Shopping ads and local inventory ads remain important formats that are shown in Google Search and Shopping results. Performance Max also builds on this to help you reach more valuable customers and drive more conversions from additional channels and inventory. And we’ve made it easy for you to measure the incremental impact of shifting from Standard Shopping campaigns to Performance Max. Will Performance Max outperform your Standard Shopping campaigns? Run an experiment to be sure. Advertisers that have shifted from Standard Shopping campaigns to Performance Max drove a 25% increase in conversion value, on average, at a similar ROAS.2 And you can test this for yourself! If you are running Standard Shopping campaigns, you can run an experiment in order to measure the uplift in conversion value from switching to Performance Max. With new one-click experiments, it’s now easier than ever to set up an A/B test that will automatically create a new Performance Max campaign from an existing Standard Shopping campaign. If you’re satisfied with the results of your A/B experiment, you can then continue running your new Performance Max campaign to replace your Standard Shopping campaign. Performance Max campaigns are goal-based and can be configured to optimize towards online sales, store sales, or omnichannel sales. By providing your goals and other inputs, you can combine your marketing expertise with the power of Google AI to maximize profitable sales. This guide offers step-by-step guidance in the following areas: Build your foundation: Follow these steps before setting up your first Performance Max campaign. Strategically plan budgets: Take a flexible and agile approach to maximize performance. Structure your campaign: Create a campaign structure that aligns with your business objectives. Provide inputs to steer AI: Combine the power of your human expertise with Google AI to drive more sales. Reporting and insights: Evaluate performance and identify new opportunities. Lay the foundation for your Performance Max campaign Enhance your product feed to help your ads stand out. Upload rich product descriptions and images, and update product prices and availability if they change often. Ensure listed products are approved and use the Product Issues column to identify missing feed attributes or spot underperforming offers. Add a local product feed to automatically enable local inventory ads in your campaigns to promote products and promotions available in stores. You can also use your feed to attract consumer attention to your ads with deals by creating promotions or price drop annotations. Set up free and fast shipping annotations to show you can ship quickly, and use return annotations to highlight return windows like “Free 90-day returns”. Consider including custom labels in your feed to signal that a product is high-priority—for example: “bestseller,” “trending,” or “holiday product”. You can then use the labels to segment these products into separate campaigns or asset groups if needed. Lay the groundwork for strong measurement to unlock business growth. Establish robust sitewide tagging with the Google tag to capture the data that matters most to you. Set up enhanced conversions to improve the accuracy of your conversion measurement and unlock more powerful bidding. Assign a store visit value or use store sales values to measure the full purchase journey and optimize your campaign to drive more purchases in stores. You can also create custom variables for store sales to access more granular reporting by customer segment or product category, for example. If you have an app, create a seamless web-to-app experience and improve campaign performance with Web to App Connect. You can set up deep links to send users directly to a relevant, in-app page when they click on your ads on the mobile web. You’ll also be able to set up in-app conversion measurement and bidding to measure in-app actions such as purchases and sign ups, and to optimize your campaign performance. Case Study “Given the rise in app usage, it was essential to track and optimize our in-app conversions for our web campaigns. We used Web to App Connect to ensure the best ad experience for customers that already have our app. After implementing Web to App Connect, we saw a 2x conversion increase and 48% average-order-value increase when customers landed in-app instead of the mobile site. This holistic bidding strategy also improved overall campaign performance, with a 68% ROAS uplift for our Performance Max campaigns.” — Marc Mulder, Head of Search, de Bijenkorf Share conversion values for better optimization and reporting. When you use conversion tracking, you can assign the same value to all conversions or let each conversion have different values. For retailers, we strongly recommend providing transaction-specific values for each conversion if your customers are purchasing items with different prices and you want to maximize total revenue. Use conversion value rules to provide additional value information that further refines your optimization. Set values for lower or higher-value types of customers, devices, locations, store visits or store sales. Plan budgets early, but be ready to capture additional sales opportunities Use Performance Planner to identify budget and bid strategies that will maximize conversion value. Use Performance Planner to review your campaign’s projected monthly and quarterly performance. Get suggestions that can help your campaigns perform better for the same spend, and find out how your spend and performance are affected if you change your budget or bid targets. Performance Planner’s forecasts are also adjusted for seasonal events so you can explore conversion opportunities during key moments like holiday. Proof Point Budget agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.3 Explore demand forecasts to take advantage of increased demand. Demand forecasts can help you to understand predicted upcoming trends relevant to your business, so you can plan budgeting and bidding strategies accordingly. Review when demand is likely to start increasing: You may already know events that are important to your business, such as Black Friday. See how demand is forecasted to increase for the products and services related to these major seasonal events. Identify new events relevant to your business: There may be less well-known events that increase the demand for your products and services. Review these and consider adjusting your campaigns to capture that demand. Check recommendations for tips on budgeting, bidding, and more. View your optimization score to see where your campaign has room to grow. The higher your score, the more optimized your campaign is. Also check your recommendations for suggestions on how to improve your campaign. For example, you may see a recommendation to raise or re-distribute your budgets for upcoming traffic increases when our simulations show that you could miss out on potential customers or that your ads may even stop running on your busiest days. You can also find and apply other types of recommendations to improve your campaign, such as optimizing for new customer acquisition. Use seasonality adjustments to optimize for short promotional or other events. If you expect a large change in conversion rates over a short period of time, you can use seasonality adjustments to prepare. Seasonality adjustments are a great tool for short, infrequent events, where you expect a significant change (e.g. >30%) in conversion rates over a narrow time window (<7 days). Examples might include a three-day mega sale or Black Friday weekend. Because conversion history is required, seasonal adjustments should only be used on existing campaigns. If you are running a longer promotion or expect a smaller conversion rate change, we recommend manually adjusting ROAS or CPA targets to help Smart Bidding accommodate the seasonality. See holiday best practices for other retail ads solutions. If you are using Merchant Center, check out our holiday best practices for Merchant Center. Structure your campaigns for success Consolidate your campaign structure to help Google AI learn and optimize faster. When setting up a new Performance Max campaign, you should consolidate your campaign structure where you can. Google AI works best when it can optimize performance across channels using a unified budget. When to create multiple campaigns. Sometimes, it does make sense to manage separate Performance Max campaigns. For example, you may have campaigns for different countries and/or languages. Or, you may have different budgets or ROAS targets for new products, top-selling products, seasonal moments, or different store locations. During the holiday season, you may want to prioritize certain types of products, and create separate Performance Max campaigns for those items. For example, you may want a campaign for holiday merchandise, a campaign for high-margin products, and a campaign for everything else. Setting a lower ROAS target can also help maximize visibility for these products in the weeks leading up to peak periods when many people are browsing. When to use asset groups to segment a single campaign. Create multiple asset groups within the same campaign to bundle assets that should serve in sets or themes (e.g. different asset groups for dinner plates vs. bowls). You may also want to create multiple asset groups if certain assets are more relevant to specific audience signals that you’ve inputted. For example, you may want different assets for a Customer Match list, such as customers who bought bikes and you now want to cross-sell bike helmets. During the holidays, we recommend creating new holiday-specific asset groups within existing campaigns. This ensures you avoid disrupting your evergreen products and helps optimize holiday performance. New holiday assets and asset groups should be uploaded at least 2 weeks in advance to make sure they're approved. Use asset group scheduling to activate the holiday or seasonal asset groups at a specific time. For example, you could schedule a new set of holiday-themed assets ahead of a special sitewide sale or promotion. Provide essential inputs to guide Google AI to deliver stronger results Implement a value-based bidding strategy to drive more performance for your budget. After you set values for your conversions, apply a value-based bidding strategy aligned with your business objectives. Use Maximize conversion value bidding to help Google AI maximize the total conversion value of your campaign within your specified daily budget. For better results, set a ROAS target based on what will yield the highest profit. Consider cost of goods sold and customer lifetime value. Reach new customers with the new customer acquisition goal. Use the new customer acquisition goal to maximize revenue while driving more new customers to your business. Choose the New Customer Value mode to optimize your campaign to prioritize and bid higher for new customers, while still maximizing sales from existing customers. New Customer Acquisition with High Value optimization is also now available in beta to help you optimize for new customers with high predicted lifetime value, while still optimizing for regular new customers and engaging existing customers. Reach out to your Google account team for more information. Choose New Customer Only mode to optimize to only new customers. With this mode, you might miss out on sales from returning customers who might not have otherwise purchased without engaging with your ad. It makes sense to choose this mode in some cases, such as when you have a specific budget dedicated to new customer acquisition. Provide as many data sources as possible to accurately detect whether someone is a new or repeat customer. Share your own definition of a new customer with website tagging (Global Site Tag and new customer parameters), provide a first-party customer list of existing customers via Customer Match, and opt in to Conversion-Based Customer Lists. Case Study Hairstory is a growing US-based hair care retailer revolutionizing the industry by imagining a future without shampoo. Working with its agency Better & Stronger, Hairstory was excited to try new customer acquisition goals with Performance Max to reach its objectives. Hairstory was able to reach more high-value customers, which helped it increase return on ad spend (ROAS) by 31%. Additionally, it achieved its objective of increasing conversions from new customers, driving a 545% increase in new customers converted. “Once someone tries our products, we have a very strong retention rate. Our main challenge is driving that initial customer acquisition. With this objective, we focused on new customer acquisition for Search and Performance Max. We’re seeing great results so far.” — Karthik Paramasivam, Head of Marketing, Hairstory Reach the right audiences by leveraging first-party data. Add audience signals that will help Google AI find relevant customers and drive more conversions. Your consented first-party data from previous purchasers shared via Customer Match is the most valuable type of audience signal. Custom segments are another useful audience signal to provide insight into the search terms, website URLs, and apps your customers typically engage with. Refresh these lists frequently to ensure your campaign makes optimization decisions based on up-to-date information. Diversify and maximize your creatives to resonate with more customers across channels. If you have online sales goals, your product feed will be used as a starting point to create and show your ads. We strongly recommend that you also add a variety of text, image and video assets and refresh them regularly. This allows your Performance Max campaign to serve across more eligible inventory so you can achieve the best results possible. If you’re optimizing to store goals, you must include the full range of creative assets: text headlines, descriptions, images, logos, video, calls-to-action, business name and a final URL. To make it easier to provide high-quality video ads, video creation tools are now integrated directly into Performance Max campaign setup and editing workflows. Note: If you do not provide your own video creative, then one or more videos may be auto-generated to help you drive more conversions from this inventory. These videos draw from your existing text assets, images, and product feed to maximize video quality and relevance. Proof Point Advertisers that included at least one video in their Performance Max campaigns saw an average increase of 12% in total conversions.4 Enable text customization and final URL expansion to drive more sales from Search. First, keep the text customization feature enabled to generate more relevant headlines and descriptions so they’re more tailored to a user’s search. Then, keep final URL expansion turned on. Final URL expansion helps you find new, converting search queries, and replaces your final URL with another landing page on your website that better matches a user’s intent. Final URL expansion also gives text customization more landing page options to draw from to help you build more diverse and relevant assets. If you need to apply exclusions to final URL expansion, you can use URL exclusions or URL parameter rules, account-level negative keywords, and campaign-level brand exclusions. Note: Final URL expansion is not available to campaigns that only optimize to store goals. Proof Point Advertisers who use final URL expansion with Performance Max campaigns see an average increase of over 9% in conversions or conversion value at a similar CPA or ROAS.5 Use reporting and insights to evaluate your results Understand changes in performance. With improved asset group reporting, you can see conversions, conversion value, cost, and a variety of other metrics at the asset group level. Discover how different asset groups influence performance and where you should prioritize improvements like adding creative assets or optimizing existing assets. Use explanations to examine performance fluctuations. Explanations convey the “why” behind significant performance changes and recommend actions to fix issues and improve performance. Top signals in your bid strategy report are another helpful way to see what factors influence your performance. Top signals may include, but are not limited to: device type, location, day of week, time of day, search queries, and Customer Match lists. Check out performance shifts insights to see which assets groups, products, and product types are driving performance changes. See which creative assets are resonating. Use Ad Strength to see if your asset quality is “low,” “good,” or “best,” and whether you need to add new assets for Google AI to use in your creative. If you already have the maximum number of assets, you can swap out your lower-quality ones for new, higher-quality assets. Understand your top-performing asset combinations for each asset group with the Combinations report. This report also helps you visualize how your different text, image and video assets are used in a variety of ad formats. Explore asset audience insights to see which assets resonate most with different audience segments. Use this to inform how you generate new creative assets to attract high-performing audiences. Understand your top customers and uncover new audiences. Check out audience insights to understand top interests and behaviors of the customers who convert from your Performance Max campaigns and to see which audiences convert at higher rates. Understand conversion data for segments you inputted as audience signals by looking at segments with a 'Signals' label. Focus on segments labeled as 'Optimized' to learn the new audience segments Google AI helped discover that you may not have known about previously. Explore how your customers are searching. Use search terms insights to understand your customers’ search queries, organized into categories. Now, you can even apply custom date ranges so you can view your historical insights. Examine search trends to see if you’re keeping up with increased demand in categories that are relevant to your business. Use these insights to plan budgets, inventory, promotions, and landing pages based on trending customer search interest. Analyze retail-centric reports. Use product insights on the Products page in Google Ads to identify product-level optimization opportunities based on market potential, and apply changes more easily with actionable recommendations. With the diagnostics tab, you can also uncover and fix issues that may be impacting the performance of individual products. With category insights on the Products page in Google Ads, you can see which product categories are trending, with the ability to adjust the granularity of the categories and subcategories that you’re viewing. View your most popular products in the best sellers report in Google Merchant Center. You can use this report to understand demand for brands and products, and prioritize which products to show in advertising campaigns. Use the price competitiveness report in Google Merchant Center to analyze how competitors are pricing similar products by category, country, and brand. Use this information to improve your pricing and bidding strategies on top products. 1.

Powered by Google AI, Performance Max helps retailers increase sales and optimize ROI across all Google Ads channels and inventory—including Search, YouTube, Display, Discover, and Google Maps. With Performance Max, Shopping ads and local inventory ads remain important formats that are shown in Google Search and Shopping results. Performance Max also builds on this to help you reach more valuable customers and drive more conversions from additional channels and inventory. And we’ve made it easy for you to measure the incremental impact of shifting from Standard Shopping campaigns to Performance Max. Will Performance Max outperform your Standard Shopping campaigns? Run an experiment to be sure. Advertisers that have shifted from Standard Shopping campaigns to Performance Max drove a 25% increase in conversion value, on average, at a similar ROAS.2 And you can test this for yourself! If you are running Standard Shopping campaigns, you can run an experiment in order to measure the uplift in conversion value from switching to Performance Max. With new one-click experiments, it’s now easier than ever to set up an A/B test that will automatically create a new Performance Max campaign from an existing Standard Shopping campaign. If you’re satisfied with the results of your A/B experiment, you can then continue running your new Performance Max campaign to replace your Standard Shopping campaign. Performance Max campaigns are goal-based and can be configured to optimize towards online sales, store sales, or omnichannel sales. By providing your goals and other inputs, you can combine your marketing expertise with the power of Google AI to maximize profitable sales. This guide offers step-by-step guidance in the following areas: Build your foundation: Follow these steps before setting up your first Performance Max campaign. Strategically plan budgets: Take a flexible and agile approach to maximize performance. Structure your campaign: Create a campaign structure that aligns with your business objectives. Provide inputs to steer AI: Combine the power of your human expertise with Google AI to drive more sales. Reporting and insights: Evaluate performance and identify new opportunities. Lay the foundation for your Performance Max campaign Enhance your product feed to help your ads stand out. Upload rich product descriptions and images, and update product prices and availability if they change often. Ensure listed products are approved and use the Product Issues column to identify missing feed attributes or spot underperforming offers. Add a local product feed to automatically enable local inventory ads in your campaigns to promote products and promotions available in stores. You can also use your feed to attract consumer attention to your ads with deals by creating promotions or price drop annotations. Set up free and fast shipping annotations to show you can ship quickly, and use return annotations to highlight return windows like “Free 90-day returns”. Consider including custom labels in your feed to signal that a product is high-priority—for example: “bestseller,” “trending,” or “holiday product”. You can then use the labels to segment these products into separate campaigns or asset groups if needed. Lay the groundwork for strong measurement to unlock business growth. Establish robust sitewide tagging with the Google tag to capture the data that matters most to you. Set up enhanced conversions to improve the accuracy of your conversion measurement and unlock more powerful bidding. Assign a store visit value or use store sales values to measure the full purchase journey and optimize your campaign to drive more purchases in stores. You can also create custom variables for store sales to access more granular reporting by customer segment or product category, for example. If you have an app, create a seamless web-to-app experience and improve campaign performance with Web to App Connect. You can set up deep links to send users directly to a relevant, in-app page when they click on your ads on the mobile web. You’ll also be able to set up in-app conversion measurement and bidding to measure in-app actions such as purchases and sign ups, and to optimize your campaign performance. Case Study “Given the rise in app usage, it was essential to track and optimize our in-app conversions for our web campaigns. We used Web to App Connect to ensure the best ad experience for customers that already have our app. After implementing Web to App Connect, we saw a 2x conversion increase and 48% average-order-value increase when customers landed in-app instead of the mobile site. This holistic bidding strategy also improved overall campaign performance, with a 68% ROAS uplift for our Performance Max campaigns.” — Marc Mulder, Head of Search, de Bijenkorf Share conversion values for better optimization and reporting. When you use conversion tracking, you can assign the same value to all conversions or let each conversion have different values. For retailers, we strongly recommend providing transaction-specific values for each conversion if your customers are purchasing items with different prices and you want to maximize total revenue. Use conversion value rules to provide additional value information that further refines your optimization. Set values for lower or higher-value types of customers, devices, locations, store visits or store sales. Plan budgets early, but be ready to capture additional sales opportunities Use Performance Planner to identify budget and bid strategies that will maximize conversion value. Use Performance Planner to review your campaign’s projected monthly and quarterly performance. Get suggestions that can help your campaigns perform better for the same spend, and find out how your spend and performance are affected if you change your budget or bid targets. Performance Planner’s forecasts are also adjusted for seasonal events so you can explore conversion opportunities during key moments like holiday. Proof Point Budget agile marketers are 25% more likely than non-agile marketers to report their performance as stronger than industry competitors.3 Explore demand forecasts to take advantage of increased demand. Demand forecasts can help you to understand predicted upcoming trends relevant to your business, so you can plan budgeting and bidding strategies accordingly. Review when demand is likely to start increasing: You may already know events that are important to your business, such as Black Friday. See how demand is forecasted to increase for the products and services related to these major seasonal events. Identify new events relevant to your business: There may be less well-known events that increase the demand for your products and services. Review these and consider adjusting your campaigns to capture that demand. Check recommendations for tips on budgeting, bidding, and more. View your optimization score to see where your campaign has room to grow. The higher your score, the more optimized your campaign is. Also check your recommendations for suggestions on how to improve your campaign. For example, you may see a recommendation to raise or re-distribute your budgets for upcoming traffic increases when our simulations show that you could miss out on potential customers or that your ads may even stop running on your busiest days. You can also find and apply other types of recommendations to improve your campaign, such as optimizing for new customer acquisition. Use seasonality adjustments to optimize for short promotional or other events. If you expect a large change in conversion rates over a short period of time, you can use seasonality adjustments to prepare. Seasonality adjustments are a great tool for short, infrequent events, where you expect a significant change (e.g. >30%) in conversion rates over a narrow time window (<7 days). Examples might include a three-day mega sale or Black Friday weekend. Because conversion history is required, seasonal adjustments should only be used on existing campaigns. If you are running a longer promotion or expect a smaller conversion rate change, we recommend manually adjusting ROAS or CPA targets to help Smart Bidding accommodate the seasonality.

Structure your campaigns for success Consolidate your campaign structure to help Google AI learn and optimize faster. When setting up a new Performance Max campaign, you should consolidate your campaign structure where you can. Google AI works best when it can optimize performance across channels using a unified budget. When to create multiple campaigns. Sometimes, it does make sense to manage separate Performance Max campaigns. For example, you may have campaigns for different countries and/or languages. Or, you may have different budgets or ROAS targets for new products, top-selling products, seasonal moments, or different store locations. During the holiday season, you may want to prioritize certain types of products, and create separate Performance Max campaigns for those items. For example, you may want a campaign for holiday merchandise, a campaign for high-margin products, and a campaign for everything else. Setting a lower ROAS target can also help maximize visibility for these products in the weeks leading up to peak periods when many people are browsing. When to use asset groups to segment a single campaign. Create multiple asset groups within the same campaign to bundle assets that should serve in sets or themes (e.g. different asset groups for dinner plates vs. bowls). You may also want to create multiple asset groups if certain assets are more relevant to specific audience signals that you’ve inputted. For example, you may want different assets for a Customer Match list, such as customers who bought bikes and you now want to cross-sell bike helmets. During the holidays, we recommend creating new holiday-specific asset groups within existing campaigns. This ensures you avoid disrupting your evergreen products and helps optimize holiday performance. New holiday assets and asset groups should be uploaded at least 2 weeks in advance to make sure they're approved. Use asset group scheduling to activate the holiday or seasonal asset groups at a specific time. For example, you could schedule a new set of holiday-themed assets ahead of a special sitewide sale or promotion. Provide essential inputs to guide Google AI to deliver stronger results Implement a value-based bidding strategy to drive more performance for your budget. After you set values for your conversions, apply a value-based bidding strategy aligned with your business objectives. Use Maximize conversion value bidding to help Google AI maximize the total conversion value of your campaign within your specified daily budget. For better results, set a ROAS target based on what will yield the highest profit. Consider cost of goods sold and customer lifetime value. Reach new customers with the new customer acquisition goal. Use the new customer acquisition goal to maximize revenue while driving more new customers to your business. Choose the New Customer Value mode to optimize your campaign to prioritize and bid higher for new customers, while still maximizing sales from existing customers. New Customer Acquisition with High Value optimization is also now available in beta to help you optimize for new customers with high predicted lifetime value, while still optimizing for regular new customers and engaging existing customers. Reach out to your Google account team for more information. Choose New Customer Only mode to optimize to only new customers. With this mode, you might miss out on sales from returning customers who might not have otherwise purchased without engaging with your ad. It makes sense to choose this mode in some cases, such as when you have a specific budget dedicated to new customer acquisition. Provide as many data sources as possible to accurately detect whether someone is a new or repeat customer. Share your own definition of a new customer with website tagging (Global Site Tag and new customer parameters), provide a first-party customer list of existing customers via Customer Match, and opt in to Conversion-Based Customer Lists. Case Study Hairstory is a growing US-based hair care retailer revolutionizing the industry by imagining a future without shampoo. Working with its agency Better & Stronger, Hairstory was excited to try new customer acquisition goals with Performance Max to reach its objectives. Hairstory was able to reach more high-value customers, which helped it increase return on ad spend (ROAS) by 31%. Additionally, it achieved its objective of increasing conversions from new customers, driving a 545% increase in new customers converted. “Once someone tries our products, we have a very strong retention rate. Our main challenge is driving that initial customer acquisition. With this objective, we focused on new customer acquisition for Search and Performance Max. We’re seeing great results so far.” — Karthik Paramasivam, Head of Marketing, Hairstory Reach the right audiences by leveraging first-party data. Add audience signals that will help Google AI find relevant customers and drive more conversions. Your consented first-party data from previous purchasers shared via Customer Match is the most valuable type of audience signal. Custom segments are another useful audience signal to provide insight into the search terms, website URLs, and apps your customers typically engage with. Refresh these lists frequently to ensure your campaign makes optimization decisions based on up-to-date information. Diversify and maximize your creatives to resonate with more customers across channels. If you have online sales goals, your product feed will be used as a starting point to create and show your ads. We strongly recommend that you also add a variety of text, image and video assets and refresh them regularly. This allows your Performance Max campaign to serve across more eligible inventory so you can achieve the best results possible. If you’re optimizing to store goals, you must include the full range of creative assets: text headlines, descriptions, images, logos, video, calls-to-action, business name and a final URL. To make it easier to provide high-quality video ads, video creation tools are now integrated directly into Performance Max campaign setup and editing workflows. Note: If you do not provide your own video creative, then one or more videos may be auto-generated to help you drive more conversions from this inventory. These videos draw from your existing text assets, images, and product feed to maximize video quality and relevance. Proof Point Advertisers that included at least one video in their Performance Max campaigns saw an average increase of 12% in total conversions.4 Enable text customization and final URL expansion to drive more sales from Search. First, keep the text customization feature enabled to generate more relevant headlines and descriptions so they’re more tailored to a user’s search. Then, keep final URL expansion turned on. Final URL expansion helps you find new, converting search queries, and replaces your final URL with another landing page on your website that better matches a user’s intent. Final URL expansion also gives text customization more landing page options to draw from to help you build more diverse and relevant assets. If you need to apply exclusions to final URL expansion, you can use URL exclusions or URL parameter rules, account-level negative keywords, and campaign-level brand exclusions. Note: Final URL expansion is not available to campaigns that only optimize to store goals. Proof Point Advertisers who use final URL expansion with Performance Max campaigns see an average increase of over 9% in conversions or conversion value at a similar CPA or ROAS.5 Use reporting and insights to evaluate your results Understand changes in performance. With improved asset group reporting, you can see conversions, conversion value, cost, and a variety of other metrics at the asset group level. Discover how different asset groups influence performance and where you should prioritize improvements like adding creative assets or optimizing existing assets. Use explanations to examine performance fluctuations. Explanations convey the “why” behind significant performance changes and recommend actions to fix issues and improve performance. Top signals in your bid strategy report are another helpful way to see what factors influence your performance. Top signals may include, but are not limited to: device type, location, day of week, time of day, search queries, and Customer Match lists. Check out performance shifts insights to see which assets groups, products, and product types are driving performance changes. See which creative assets are resonating. Use Ad Strength to see if your asset quality is “low,” “good,” or “best,” and whether you need to add new assets for Google AI to use in your creative. If you already have the maximum number of assets, you can swap out your lower-quality ones for new, higher-quality assets. Understand your top-performing asset combinations for each asset group with the Combinations report. This report also helps you visualize how your different text, image and video assets are used in a variety of ad formats. Explore asset audience insights to see which assets resonate most with different audience segments. Use this to inform how you generate new creative assets to attract high-performing audiences. Understand your top customers and uncover new audiences. Check out audience insights to understand top interests and behaviors of the customers who convert from your Performance Max campaigns and to see which audiences convert at higher rates. Understand conversion data for segments you inputted as audience signals by looking at segments with a 'Signals' label. Focus on segments labeled as 'Optimized' to learn the new audience segments Google AI helped discover that you may not have known about previously. Explore how your customers are searching. Use search terms insights to understand your customers’ search queries, organized into categories. Now, you can even apply custom date ranges so you can view your historical insights. Examine search trends to see if you’re keeping up with increased demand in categories that are relevant to your business. Use these insights to plan budgets, inventory, promotions, and landing pages based on trending customer search interest. Analyze retail-centric reports. Use product insights on the Products page in Google Ads to identify product-level optimization opportunities based on market potential, and apply changes more easily with actionable recommendations. With the diagnostics tab, you can also uncover and fix issues that may be impacting the performance of individual products. With category insights on the Products page in Google Ads, you can see which product categories are trending, with the ability to adjust the granularity of the categories and subcategories that you’re viewing. View your most popular products in the best sellers report in Google Merchant Center. You can use this report to understand demand for brands and products, and prioritize which products to show in advertising campaigns. Use the price competitiveness report in Google Merchant Center to analyze how competitors are pricing similar products by category, country, and brand. Use this information to improve your pricing and bidding strategies on top products. 1.

Enter multiple headlines and descriptions when creating a responsive search ad, and over time, Google Ads tests different combinations and learns which combinations perform best. By adapting your ad’s content to more closely match potential customers’ search terms, responsive search ads may improve your campaign’s performance. Tips Assets can be shown in any order, so make sure they make sense individually or in combinations, and don't violate our policies or local law. It’s recommended to have one responsive search ad per ad group with at least 'Good' or 'Excellent' Ad Strength. There’s a limit of 3 enabled responsive search ads per ad group. If you have text that should appear in every ad, you must pin the text to either Headline position 1, Headline position 2, or Description position 1. Check out the Search Automation technical guide to learn more about the signals Google uses, how queries match to keywords, how Google's AI makes keyword matching more effective, and what you can do to improve performance. Learn more about Creating effective Search ads. For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select \"Subtitles/CC\" and choose your language. Benefits Responsive search ads help you: Create flexible ads that adapt to device widths, giving you more room to share your message with potential customers. Save time by providing multiple headline and description options, allowing Google Ads to show the most relevant combinations to your customers. Tailor your headlines and descriptions to your customers’ locations, regular locations, or locations of interest. Reach more potential customers with multiple headline and description options that give your ads the opportunity to compete in more auctions and match more queries. Increase ad group performance by attracting more clicks and conversions that your existing text ads aren’t capturing because responsive search ads help you compete in more auctions. How it works The more headlines and descriptions you enter, the more opportunities Google Ads has to serve ads that more closely match your potential customers’ search queries, which can improve your ad performance. After you enter headlines and descriptions, Google Ads assembles the text into multiple ad combinations in a way that avoids redundancy. Unlike expanded text ads, you can provide up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions for a single responsive search ad. Next, in any given ad, a minimum of one headline and one description will be selected to show in different combinations and orders. Part of your ad text may automatically appear in bold when it matches or closely matches a user's search query. Over time, Google Ads will test the most promising ad combinations, and learn which combinations are the most relevant for different queries. Responsive search ads show one, two, or three headlines based on what is predicted to perform best for each person’s unique search query. Headline asset text may show at the beginning of the description when it’s predicted to perform best. If you have assets that are pinned to headline position 1, headline position 2, or description position 1, they'll continue to show in their designated positions when your ads serve. Learn how to Pin headlines and descriptions to specific positions. To help your ads show in their entirety when possible, responsive search ads have character limits. The headline fields for responsive search ads support up to 30 characters. The description fields support up to 90 characters each, and the path fields support up to 15 each. Every character in a double width language like Korean, Japanese, or Chinese counts as 2 characters. Learn more about Text ad requirements. Optimize your campaign as you create it As you create your campaign, you may receive notifications based on your setting selections. These notifications may alert you of issues that can result in decreased performance or that may be significant enough to prevent you from publishing your campaign. The campaign construction navigation menu that appears as you construct your campaign provides a holistic view of your construction progress and will call attention to notifications that you may want to address. Move between steps in the navigation menu to easily review and resolve potential issues with your targeting, bidding, budget, or other campaign settings. Learn how to Set up your campaign for success. Instructions Create a responsive search ad In your Google Ads account, click the Campaigns icon. Click the Campaigns drop down in the section menu. Click Ads. Click the plus button and select Responsive search ad. Enter the final URL and display path text. As you type, a preview of your ad will appear to the right. Note: The preview shows potential ads built using your assets. Not all combinations are shown, and some shortening may occur in some formats. Enter your headlines. You’ll need to enter a minimum of 3 headlines, but you can enter up to 15. Enter your descriptions. You’ll need to enter a minimum of 2 descriptions, but you can enter up to 4. Click Save. Tips for entering your headlines Keep in mind that headlines and descriptions may appear in any order. Try writing the first 3 headlines as if they’ll appear together in your ad. Be sure to include at least one of your keywords in your headlines, and create headlines that are relevant to the keywords you’re targeting. Focus on providing as many unique headlines as you can. More headlines give Google Ads more options to assemble your messages into relevant ads, which may increase performance. Try highlighting additional product or service benefits, a problem you’re solving, or shipping and returns information. Learn more about Creating effective Search ads. You can provide even more headlines by creating variations of the headlines you’ve already entered. For example, try a different call to action. Edit a responsive search ad In your Google Ads account, click the Campaigns icon. Click the Campaigns drop down in the section menu. Click Ads. Click on the bar above the table of results to add a filter. In the drop-down menu that appears, click Attributes, then Ad type. Check the box next to “Responsive search ad”. In the table of results, hover over the ad you wish to edit, then click the edit icon . Select Edit. Make your desired changes to the ad’s URL, final URL, headlines, descriptions, or URL options. Click Save. Note: Removing or editing any headlines or descriptions can change the ads that are serving and may impact your performance. Will all of the text in my responsive search ad appear when my ad is served? Usually when your ad is served, all of the ad text that you’ve entered in the Headline 1 and Description 1 fields will appear along with it. The second headline, third headline, and second description fields may appear based on what’s predicted to perform best, or when there’s enough space. The second headline, third headline, and second description fields aren’t guaranteed to appear in your ads. In some instances, Google Ads may need to shorten your text, usually with an ellipsis (“...”). For example, if you use call assets, the “Call” button may take the place of portions of your ad text. If your ad text frequently uses wider characters, like “m”, instead of narrower characters, like “i”, your headline text may be wider than the space available on some browser sizes. With most Latin languages, you can pin Headline 1 and Headline 2 and limit your combined headline character count to 33 to avoid changes in the way your text is displayed. If your responsive search ads show on the Google Display Network, Headline 2 may not show in some ad formats. If you have text that should appear in every ad, such as a legal disclaimer, then you must include that information in either Headline 1 or Description 1. As a reminder, if you have assets that are pinned to the headline position 1, headline position 2, or description position 1, they'll continue to show in their designated positions when your ads serve. Pin headlines and descriptions to specific positions By default, when you create a responsive search ad, headlines and descriptions can appear in any order. You can control where individual headlines and descriptions appear in your ad by pinning headlines and descriptions to specific positions. For example, if you need to show a disclaimer in every ad, you can write the disclaimer as a responsive search ad description, and pin it to Description position 1. This ensures that all ads shown to customers will include the disclaimer in the first part of the description. Create or edit a responsive search ad (refer to the steps above). To the right of any headline or description you wish to pin, click the pin icon , then choose the position you’d like to pin that headline or description to. To pin any headline or description that’s unpinned, click the pin icon , then select the position you’d like to show the headline or description in. Click Save. Note: Removing or editing any headlines or descriptions can change the ads that are serving and may impact your performance. Tips Pinning one headline or description causes it to show only in that specific position, preventing other headlines or descriptions from showing in its place. Because pinning reduces the overall number of headlines or descriptions that can be matched to a potential customer's search, pinning isn't recommended for most advertisers and can affect ad strength. Try pinning 2 or 3 headlines or descriptions to each position so that any of them can show in that position. This gives you more flexibility to find out which headlines or descriptions perform better. Example: If you pin the headline “Official Website” to Headline position 1, all ads will have “Official Website” as the first headline. However, if you pin a second headline, such as, “The Official Site,\" to Headline position 1, all ads will show either “Official Website” or “The Official Site” as the first headline. If you have headlines and/or descriptions pinned to all available positions, unpinned headlines and/or descriptions won’t show. Headlines or descriptions pinned to Headline position 1, Headline position 2, or Description position 1 will always show. Content pinned to Headline position 3 and Description position 2 are not guaranteed to show in every ad. If you have text that should appear in every ad, then you must pin it to either Headline position 1, Headline position 2, or Description position 1. Report on the performance of your responsive search ads On the \"Ads\" page you can find the same performance metrics for each responsive search ad that are listed for your other text ads. The stats table shows the totals for all of the ad combinations that were created using the headlines and descriptions you entered for each responsive search ad. In your Google Ads account, click the Campaigns icon. Click the Campaigns drop down in the section menu. Click Ads. In the drop-down menu that appears, click Attributes, then Ad type. Check the box next to “Responsive search ad”. Optional: To adjust the columns and data that appear in your report, click the columns icon and select Modify columns.

Note: Removing or editing any headlines or descriptions can change the ads that are serving and may impact your performance. Tips Pinning one headline or description causes it to show only in that specific position, preventing other headlines or descriptions from showing in its place. Because pinning reduces the overall number of headlines or descriptions that can be matched to a potential customer's search, pinning isn't recommended for most advertisers and can affect ad strength. Try pinning 2 or 3 headlines or descriptions to each position so that any of them can show in that position. This gives you more flexibility to find out which headlines or descriptions perform better. Example: If you pin the headline “Official Website” to Headline position 1, all ads will have “Official Website” as the first headline. However, if you pin a second headline, such as, “The Official Site,\" to Headline position 1, all ads will show either “Official Website” or “The Official Site” as the first headline. If you have headlines and/or descriptions pinned to all available positions, unpinned headlines and/or descriptions won’t show. Headlines or descriptions pinned to Headline position 1, Headline position 2, or Description position 1 will always show. Content pinned to Headline position 3 and Description position 2 are not guaranteed to show in every ad. If you have text that should appear in every ad, then you must pin it to either Headline position 1, Headline position 2, or Description position 1. Report on the performance of your responsive search ads On the \"Ads\" page you can find the same performance metrics for each responsive search ad that are listed for your other text ads. The stats table shows the totals for all of the ad combinations that were created using the headlines and descriptions you entered for each responsive search ad. In your Google Ads account, click the Campaigns icon. Click the Campaigns drop down in the section menu. Click Ads. In the drop-down menu that appears, click Attributes, then Ad type. Check the box next to “Responsive search ad”. Optional: To adjust the columns and data that appear in your report, click the columns icon and select Modify columns. Choose the columns that you’d like to appear in your report. Learn more About columns in your statistics table. Click Apply. Click the download icon . Select the format of the report (for example, .csv, .pdf). Optional: You can choose to open your report in the Report Editor, schedule the report, or have it emailed to you. Learn how to Create, save, and schedule reports from your statistics tables. You can also view the reporting for individual assets and the combination of assets.

Learn how to Manage your responsive display ads. A long headline (90 characters or fewer). A description (at least 1, or up to 5 descriptions).

This is a great asset to take advantage of because it can improve engagement with your ad. To use promotion text, click More options, check the box beside “Dynamic ad options”, and add your promotion text. Here are some best practices for promotion text: Be specific about your offer. “30% off all school supplies” is better than “30% off”. Avoid overhyping your offer. ALL CAPS and excessive punctuation may turn off users. Avoid repetition. Promotional text should never repeat your brand name. Effective messages: New product announcements, sweepstakes, in-store deals, flash sales. Many users are very sensitive to price related text. Sales or price related promotions usually have better performance than a company slogan. Promotion text is not supposed to last for a long time, for example, more than 6 months. If you would like to always display some text (for example, a company slogan) to users, a short headline would be more suitable. Preview the most popular sizes and ad formats of your potential ads.

        "title": "About Dynamic Search Ads",
        "content": "About Dynamic Search Ads Dynamic Search Ads are the easiest way to find customers searching on Google for precisely what you offer. Ideal for advertisers with a well-developed website or a large inventory, Dynamic Search Ads use your website content to target your ads and can help fill in the gaps of your keyword based campaigns. Dynamic Search Ad headlines and landing pages are also generated using content from your website, which keeps your ads relevant and saves you time. All you need to do is add a creative description. Without Dynamic Search Ads, even well-managed Google Ads accounts with many keywords can miss relevant searches, experience delays getting ads written for new products, or get out of sync with what's actually available on advertisers’ websites. This article explains how Dynamic Search Ads work, and how they might benefit you. For instructions, go to Create a Dynamic Search Ad. Note: Dynamic Search Ads is sometimes abbreviated as DSA. Benefits of using Dynamic Search Ads Saves time. No more mapping keywords, bids, and ad text to each product on your website. Plus, Dynamic Search Ads may help you advertise to new markets faster than other alternatives. Show relevant, dynamically generated headlines with your ads. When a customer's search is relevant to your product or service, Google Ads will dynamically generate an ad with a clear headline for the most relevant page on your site. Steer your ads. With Google AI, you can show ads based on your entire website, or specific categories or pages. Or, prevent your ads from showing for products that are temporarily out-of-stock. Capture additional traffic. Dynamic Search Ads can help you gain additional traffic and sales identifying new serving opportunities that you aren’t already targeting with keywords. Display URLs are based on your final URL domain. You no longer have to enter your display URL when creating a new ad. Instead, Google Ads will use the domain from your final URL and show it as your ad’s display URL. For example, if your ad's final URL is www.example.com/outdoor/hiking/shoes, the URL on your ad will appear as www.example.com. How they show When someone searches on Google with terms closely related to the titles and frequently used phrases on your website, Google Ads will use these titles and phrases to select a landing page from your website and generate a clear, relevant headline for your ad. Example: You own an international hotel chain. Someone searching on Google for “luxury hotel New York” views your ad with the headline “Luxury hotel - NYC,” clicks your ad, and then lands on the page of your site that's dedicated to your New York luxury locations. In this way, Dynamic Search Ads can quickly direct potential customers to what they want on your site. You're responsible for the final text that appears in your ad, so keep this in mind when choosing which landing pages to target. The most important signal, among the many used to generate your ad’s headline is the HTML title of your page. How targeting works Dynamic Search Ads use content from the landing pages on your website to target your ads to searches. You can choose from a variety of targeting options to specify which landing pages that Dynamic Search Ads should use. You can target groups of URLs with targeting types such as URL_Contains or “Categories”, or target specific URLs with URL_Equals or Page Feeds. More details below: URL_Equals: Targets individual URLs from your website. For example, if you’re new to Dynamic Search Ads and want to test it out, you can create a URL_Equals target for your website’s home page. URL_Contains: Targets pages with URLs containing certain strings. Categories: Google Ads-generated sets of landing pages from your website, organized by theme. You decide which sets of pages to target, how to group similar pages, and the level of detail. If you want to start using Dynamic Search Ads quickly, the “Landing pages from your standard ad groups” category targets all webpages that you’re currently running search ads against in your account. It makes it easy to increase traffic on the webpages that you’re already using as landing pages in existing ad groups and campaigns. Categories such as “Landing pages from your standard ad groups” are available only for domains for which Google Ads can generate categories. Page feed: Upload a spreadsheet of URLs for the most focused controlled targeting. You can then target your entire feed or parts of it. For instance, you can label pages about \"products with 4-star reviews\" or \"hotels with lots of availability” and target URLs with those labels only. Learn more about Dynamic Search Ad targeting. Note: There is a limit of 100 page feeds per account. How headlines work Dynamic Search Ads headlines are dynamically generated headlines that target relevant searches based on the user’s search and the text that's most relevant to your landing page or domain. When you submit your page, domain, website or product feed, Google web crawling technology will find text that can be used for headlines relevant to the page content, which can then drive more searches to your page. Note: Text retrieved from your website may have minor modifications to avoid violation of Google editorial policies (such as changing capitalization or removing unsupported characters), and we're unable to guarantee which headline will serve beforehand as we may make modifications to better align the headline with the search, page content, and our ad integrity policies. To increase the effectiveness of your Dynamic Search Ads headlines, we recommend you adjust your website headlines and titles in this way: Follow Google standard creative editorial policy rules for the page title and headlines Have unique calls to action Keep the titles and headlines on your website limited to 60 or 90 characters Best practices On May 31, 2024, existing ad customizers for text ads, expanded text ads and Dynamic Search Ads will stop serving (after this date they will only be able to serve with their default value): Update your Search Ads: If you need ad customizers for Search ads, we recommend that you transition to responsive search ads and create ad customizers for responsive search ads before May 31, 2024. Check for default values: If your customizers have default values, your ads will continue to serve with those values after May 31, 2024. Update your Dynamic Search Ads: If your ads have no default values, remove ads customizers from your Dynamic Search Ad descriptions and replace them with updated, regular description text to keep your ads serving after May 31, 2024. Dynamic Search Ads aren't recommended if your website changes rapidly—with, for instance, daily deals. Dynamic Search Ads work best for websites with well-written HTML page titles and clearly-written content. Page content is used to produce headlines for your creatives, and decide which queries are good matches for the page. Advertisers, especially of sensitive industries, must ensure that they have the right certifications and the right audience set. Dynamic Search Ads work best with well-optimized pages where Dynamic Search Ads can identify themes and terms on the webpage. Dynamic Search Ads doesn’t work well with websites that are in a format that Google Ads can’t do this for (for example, sites that contain mostly Flash content or images, or sites that require users to sign in to access the majority of the site's content). Dynamic Search Ads work best when you regularly check your search terms reports. You can also keep them optimized by using negative keywords. These steps can help you keep your ads on-topic and prevent unwanted pages from getting indexed. Learn how to Create exclusions for Dynamic Search Ads. Before using Dynamic Search Ads, be sure to review Google Ads policies to make sure your ads comply with them (and any applicable laws).

        "title": "About Dynamic Search Ads",
        "content": "About Dynamic Search Ads Dynamic Search Ads are the easiest way to find customers searching on Google for precisely what you offer. Ideal for advertisers with a well-developed website or a large inventory, Dynamic Search Ads use your website content to target your ads and can help fill in the gaps of your keyword based campaigns. Dynamic Search Ad headlines and landing pages are also generated using content from your website, which keeps your ads relevant and saves you time. All you need to do is add a creative description. Without Dynamic Search Ads, even well-managed Google Ads accounts with many keywords can miss relevant searches, experience delays getting ads written for new products, or get out of sync with what's actually available on advertisers’ websites. This article explains how Dynamic Search Ads work, and how they might benefit you. For instructions, go to Create a Dynamic Search Ad. Note: Dynamic Search Ads is sometimes abbreviated as DSA. Benefits of using Dynamic Search Ads Saves time. No more mapping keywords, bids, and ad text to each product on your website. Plus, Dynamic Search Ads may help you advertise to new markets faster than other alternatives. Show relevant, dynamically generated headlines with your ads. When a customer's search is relevant to your product or service, Google Ads will dynamically generate an ad with a clear headline for the most relevant page on your site. Steer your ads. With Google AI, you can show ads based on your entire website, or specific categories or pages. Or, prevent your ads from showing for products that are temporarily out-of-stock. Capture additional traffic. Dynamic Search Ads can help you gain additional traffic and sales identifying new serving opportunities that you aren’t already targeting with keywords. Display URLs are based on your final URL domain. You no longer have to enter your display URL when creating a new ad. Instead, Google Ads will use the domain from your final URL and show it as your ad’s display URL. For example, if your ad's final URL is www.example.com/outdoor/hiking/shoes, the URL on your ad will appear as www.example.com. How they show When someone searches on Google with terms closely related to the titles and frequently used phrases on your website, Google Ads will use these titles and phrases to select a landing page from your website and generate a clear, relevant headline for your ad. Example: You own an international hotel chain. Someone searching on Google for “luxury hotel New York” views your ad with the headline “Luxury hotel - NYC,” clicks your ad, and then lands on the page of your site that's dedicated to your New York luxury locations. In this way, Dynamic Search Ads can quickly direct potential customers to what they want on your site. You're responsible for the final text that appears in your ad, so keep this in mind when choosing which landing pages to target. The most important signal, among the many used to generate your ad’s headline is the HTML title of your page. How targeting works Dynamic Search Ads use content from the landing pages on your website to target your ads to searches. You can choose from a variety of targeting options to specify which landing pages that Dynamic Search Ads should use. You can target groups of URLs with targeting types such as URL_Contains or “Categories”, or target specific URLs with URL_Equals or Page Feeds. More details below: URL_Equals: Targets individual URLs from your website. For example, if you’re new to Dynamic Search Ads and want to test it out, you can create a URL_Equals target for your website’s home page. URL_Contains: Targets pages with URLs containing certain strings. Categories: Google Ads-generated sets of landing pages from your website, organized by theme. You decide which sets of pages to target, how to group similar pages, and the level of detail. If you want to start using Dynamic Search Ads quickly, the “Landing pages from your standard ad groups” category targets all webpages that you’re currently running search ads against in your account. It makes it easy to increase traffic on the webpages that you’re already using as landing pages in existing ad groups and campaigns. Categories such as “Landing pages from your standard ad groups” are available only for domains for which Google Ads can generate categories. Page feed: Upload a spreadsheet of URLs for the most focused controlled targeting. You can then target your entire feed or parts of it. For instance, you can label pages about \"products with 4-star reviews\" or \"hotels with lots of availability” and target URLs with those labels only. Learn more about Dynamic Search Ad targeting. Note: There is a limit of 100 page feeds per account. How headlines work Dynamic Search Ads headlines are dynamically generated headlines that target relevant searches based on the user’s search and the text that's most relevant to your landing page or domain. When you submit your page, domain, website or product feed, Google web crawling technology will find text that can be used for headlines relevant to the page content, which can then drive more searches to your page. Note: Text retrieved from your website may have minor modifications to avoid violation of Google editorial policies (such as changing capitalization or removing unsupported characters), and we're unable to guarantee which headline will serve beforehand as we may make modifications to better align the headline with the search, page content, and our ad integrity policies. To increase the effectiveness of your Dynamic Search Ads headlines, we recommend you adjust your website headlines and titles in this way: Follow Google standard creative editorial policy rules for the page title and headlines Have unique calls to action Keep the titles and headlines on your website limited to 60 or 90 characters Best practices On May 31, 2024, existing ad customizers for text ads, expanded text ads and Dynamic Search Ads will stop serving (after this date they will only be able to serve with their default value): Update your Search Ads: If you need ad customizers for Search ads, we recommend that you transition to responsive search ads and create ad customizers for responsive search ads before May 31, 2024. Check for default values: If your customizers have default values, your ads will continue to serve with those values after May 31, 2024. Update your Dynamic Search Ads: If your ads have no default values, remove ads customizers from your Dynamic Search Ad descriptions and replace them with updated, regular description text to keep your ads serving after May 31, 2024. Dynamic Search Ads aren't recommended if your website changes rapidly—with, for instance, daily deals. Dynamic Search Ads work best for websites with well-written HTML page titles and clearly-written content. Page content is used to produce headlines for your creatives, and decide which queries are good matches for the page. Advertisers, especially of sensitive industries, must ensure that they have the right certifications and the right audience set. Dynamic Search Ads work best with well-optimized pages where Dynamic Search Ads can identify themes and terms on the webpage. Dynamic Search Ads doesn’t work well with websites that are in a format that Google Ads can’t do this for (for example, sites that contain mostly Flash content or images, or sites that require users to sign in to access the majority of the site's content).

Dynamic prospecting and dynamic remarketing Dynamic prospecting brings user information and product information together to show your best product at the right time to the most interested users. Unlike dynamic remarketing, which is focused on getting the most value out of your existing customers, dynamic prospecting is used to acquire new users. This difference makes dynamic prospecting the preferable method if you’re a new advertiser or if you’re targeting an audience different from your own data segments (including your data segments that include website visitors and app users). How dynamic prospecting works Dynamic prospecting uses machine learning to get an idea for what potential buyers are looking for. Once the system knows what the user is after, it combines that want with demographics-based information such as age, gender, and household income to match the user with a product in your feed. The products in your feed are evaluated based on performance, relevance, and other factors to determine which ones are most likely to catch the user’s attention and lead to conversions. You can only add a feed to your campaign if you haven't added one before. You can change a feed after campaign construction only if the feed is within the same business type.
