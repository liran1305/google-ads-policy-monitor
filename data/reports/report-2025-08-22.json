        "content": "Google Ads policies Google provides translated versions of the Advertising Policies Help Center, though they're not meant to change the content of the policies. The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the Display & Video 360 help center for additional restrictions. Welcome to the Google Advertising Policies Center Overview of our policies and how we enforce them We strive to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem that's trustworthy and transparent for users, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose of this help center is to help you build Google Ads campaigns that align with our advertising policies listed below. These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our users and abide by applicable laws. This means that our policies prohibit content that is harmful to users and the overall advertising ecosystem. Our advertising policies cover 4 broad areas: Prohibited content: Content you can't advertise on the Google Network Prohibited practices: Things you can't do if you want to advertise with us Restricted content and features: Content you can advertise, but with limitations Editorial and technical: Quality standards for your ads, websites, and apps To learn more about which policies are included in these broad categories, click the links for the category names to review the content below. For additional details about each policy, click the header of the section to learn more. We use a combination of Google AI and human evaluation to ensure that ads comply with these policies. Our enforcement technologies use Google AI, modeled on human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. More complex, nuanced or severe cases are often reviewed and evaluated by our specially-trained experts. We take action on content that violates our policies. This may include disapproving violating ads so they don’t serve, as well as suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and continue to expand a strike system for repeat offenders. We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions we take. If one of your ads is disapproved, you can fix that ad or appeal the decision. You can also appeal an account suspension decision. For these links to work, you’ll need to be signed into your Google Ads account. Note: For DV360 ad disapprovals, learn more about how to Find and fix rejected creatives. You can also Appeal a DV360 account suspension. Prohibited content Counterfeit goods Google Ads prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner. This policy applies to the content of your ad and your website or app. Dangerous products or services We want to help keep people safe both online and offline, so we don't allow the promotion of some products or services that cause damage, harm, or injury. Examples of dangerous content (non-exhaustive): Recreational drugs (chemical or herbal); psychoactive substances; equipment to facilitate drug use; weapons, ammunition, explosive materials and fireworks; instructions for making explosives or other harmful products; tobacco products Enabling dishonest behavior Google Ads values honesty and fairness and doesn’t allow the promotion of products or services that are designed to enable dishonest behavior. Below are some examples of what to avoid in your ads. Learn more about What happens if you violate our policies. Examples of products or services that enable dishonest behavior (non-exhaustive): Hacking software or instructions; services designed to artificially inflate ad or website traffic; fake documents; academic cheating services Inappropriate content Google Ads values diversity and respect for others and strives to avoid offending users, so ads or destinations that display shocking content or promote hatred, intolerance, discrimination, or violence aren’t allowed. Examples of inappropriate or offensive content (non-exhaustive): bullying or intimidation of an individual or group, racial discrimination, content promoting hate groups or hate group paraphernalia, graphic crime scene or accident images, cruelty to animals, murder, self-harm, extortion or blackmail, sale or trade of endangered species, ads using profane language, and content promoting the sexual exploitation of minors Prohibited practices Abusing the ad network Ads across the Google Network should be useful, varied, relevant, and safe for users. Google Ads doesn't allow advertisers to attempt to trick or circumvent our ad review processes with their ads, content, or destinations. Learn more about the Abusing the ad network policy. Examples of abusing of the ad network (non-exhaustive): promoting content that contains malware; \"cloaking\" or using other techniques to hide the true destination that users are directed to; \"arbitrage\" or promoting destinations for the sole or primary purpose of showing ads; promoting \"bridge\" or \"gateway\" destinations that are solely designed to send users elsewhere; advertising with the sole or primary intent of gaining public social network endorsements from the user; \"gaming\" or manipulating settings in an attempt to circumvent our policy review systems Data collection and use We want users to trust that information about them will be respected and handled with appropriate care. As such, our advertising partners should not misuse this information, nor collect it for unclear purposes or without appropriate disclosures or security measures. Note that additional policies apply when using personalized advertising, which includes remarketing and custom audiences. If you use personalized advertising targeting features, be sure to review the personalized ads data collection and use policies. Examples of user information that should be handled with care (non-exhaustive): full name; email address; mailing address; phone number; national identity, pension, social security, tax ID, health care, or driver's license number; birth date or mother's maiden name in addition to any of the above information; financial status; political affiliation; sexual orientation; race or ethnicity; religion Examples of irresponsible data collection & use (non-exhaustive): obtaining credit card information over a non-secure server, promotions that claim to know a user's sexual orientation or financial status, violations of our policies that apply to interest-based advertising and remarketing Misrepresentation Ads or destinations that deceive users by excluding relevant product information or providing misleading information about products, services, and businesses can compromise user trust in the Google Ads platform. The Misrepresentation policy strives to ensure that ads are clear, honest, and provide information that users need to make informed decisions. Below are some examples of what to avoid in your ads. Learn more about What happens if you violate our policies. Examples of misrepresentation (non-exhaustive): omitting or obscuring billing details such as how, what, and when users will be charged; omitting or obscuring charges associated with financial services such as interest rates, fees, and penalties; failing to display tax or licence numbers, contact information, or physical address where relevant; making offers that aren't actually available; making misleading or unrealistic claims regarding weight loss or financial gain; collecting donations under false pretenses; \"phishing\" or falsely purporting to be a reputable company in order to get users to part with valuable personal or financial information Restricted content and features The policies below cover content that is sometimes legally or culturally sensitive. Online advertising can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate. For that reason, we allow the promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and advertisers may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all ad products, features, or networks are able to support this restricted content. Further details can be found in the Policy Manager. Ad protections for children and teens Our child and teen ads policies, along with other Google Ads policies (including but not limited to those for alcohol, gambling, and high fat, sugar, and salt food and beverages), work together to provide strong protections that include: Disabling ads personalization Restricting sensitive ad content and categories We require all our advertisers to follow local legal requirements when using our products, including any regulations on advertising to users under age 18, as well as all Google Ads policies. Learn more about our Ad protections for children and teens and relevant ad policies, where they apply, and what they mean for advertisers. Sexual content Ads should respect user preferences and comply with legal regulations, so we don't allow certain kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations. Some kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations are allowed only if they comply with the policies below and don't target minors, but they will only show in limited scenarios based on user search queries, user age, and local laws where the ad is being served. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. Examples of restricted sexual content (non-exhaustive): Visible genitalia and female breasts, hook-up dating, sex toys, strip clubs, sexually suggestive live chat, models in sexualized poses Alcohol We abide by local alcohol laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of alcohol-related advertising, both for alcohol and drinks that resemble alcohol. Some types of alcohol-related ads are allowed if they meet the policies below, don’t target minors, and target only countries that are explicitly allowed to show alcohol ads. Examples of restricted alcoholic beverages (non-exhaustive): beer, wine, sake, spirits or hard alcohol, Champagne, fortified wine, non-alcoholic beer, non-alcoholic wine, non-alcoholic distilled spirits Copyrights We abide by local copyright laws and protect the rights of copyright holders, so we don’t allow ads that are unauthorized to use copyrighted content. If you are legally authorized to use copyrighted content, apply for certification (or here for DV360) to advertise. If you see unauthorized content, submit a copyright-related complaint. Examples of restricted copyrighted content (non-exhaustive): sites or apps that facilitate unauthorized offline distribution of copyrighted content; unauthorized sites or software that capture, copy, or provide access to copyrighted content Gambling and games We support responsible gambling advertising and abide by local gambling laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of gambling-related advertising. Gambling-related ads are allowed if they comply with the policies below and the advertiser has received the proper Google Ads certification. Gambling ads must target approved countries, have a landing page that displays information about responsible gambling, and never target minors. Check local regulations for the areas you want to target. Examples of restricted gambling-related content (non-exhaustive): physical casinos; sites where users can bet on poker, bingo, roulette, or sports events; national or private lotteries; sports odds aggregator sites; sites offering bonus codes or promotional offers for gambling sites; online educational materials for casino-based games; sites offering \"poker-for-fun\" games; non-casino-based cash game sites Healthcare and medicines We're dedicated to following advertising regulations for healthcare and medicine, so we expect that ads and destinations follow appropriate laws and industry standards. Some healthcare-related content can’t be advertised at all, while others can only be advertised if the advertiser is certified with Google and targets only approved locations. Check local regulations for the locations you want to target. For most healthcare policies, if your ad campaign targets allowed locations and the domain is properly certified, your ad will be labeled “Eligible (limited)” and can run in allowed locations. Examples of restricted healthcare content (non-exhaustive): clinical trial recruitment; HIV home tests; addiction services; prescription drug services Political content We support responsible political advertising and expect all political ads and destinations to comply with local campaign and election laws for any areas they target. This policy includes legally mandated election “silence periods.” Examples of political content (non-exhaustive): promotion of political parties or candidates, political issue advocacy Financial products and services We want users to have adequate information to make informed financial decisions. Our policies are designed to give users information to weigh the costs associated with financial products and services, and to protect users from harmful or deceitful practices. For the purposes of this policy, we consider financial products and services to be those related to the management or investment of money and cryptocurrencies, including personalized advice. When promoting financial products and services, you must comply with state and local regulations for any location that your ads target — for example, include specific disclosures required by local law. Advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Below you can find policy requirements related to financial services, personal loans, and certain restricted financial products. As the online advertising and regulatory space continues to evolve, we'll update this policy with additional product-specific guidelines on an ongoing basis. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies. Examples of restricted Financial products and services (non-exhaustive): personal loans, loan modification, credit repair services Cryptocurrencies and related products Due to the complex and evolving nature of regulations related to cryptocurrencies and related products and services, we allow certain categories of cryptocurrency-related products and services to be advertised with and without certification by Google in limited circumstances. While most advertisers must be certified by Google, there may be limited circumstances where certification is not required. Examples of cryptocurrency businesses that may not require certification (non-exhaustive): businesses accepting payment in cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency mining hardware, NFT games that allow players to purchase in-game items, like virtual apparel for a player’s characters, consumed or used in a game to enhance a user’s experience or aid users in advancing the game. Examples of cryptocurrency businesses that require certification (non-exhaustive): cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, cryptocurrency coin trusts When promoting cryptocurrencies and related products, you must comply with state and local regulations for any region or country that your ads target. Refer to our non-exhaustive list of location-specific requirements for more information but note that advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Trademarks There are multiple factors that determine when trademarks can be used in ads. Along with the factors described in our Policy Center, these policies apply only when a trademark owner has submitted a valid complaint to Google. Legal requirements You’re always responsible for ensuring that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations, in addition to Google's advertising policies, for all of the locations where your ads are showing. Other restricted businesses We restrict certain businesses from advertising to prevent user exploitation, even if they comply with other policies. Continuous reviews and feedback from users, regulators, and consumer protection authorities help us identify products or services that are prone to abuse. We may limit or stop ads from businesses that pose an unreasonable risk to user safety or experience. Restricted ad formats and features There are multiple factors that determine access to advanced ad formats and features on Google Ads. Certain ad formats are not available for all advertisers until they meet our specific requirements or complete the certification process. Limited ad serving To protect the integrity of our Google Ads ecosystem, we limit impressions of ads that have a higher potential of causing abuse or a poor experience for our users. In these specific instances, only qualified advertisers will be able to serve ads without impression limits. Learn more about when limited ad serving applies and who is a qualified advertiser. Editorial and technical requirements We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users. We've also specified technical requirements to help users and advertisers get the most out of the variety of ad formats we offer. Editorial In order to provide a quality user experience, Google requires that all ads, assets, and destinations meet high professional and editorial standards. We only allow ads that are clear, professional in appearance, and that lead users to content that is relevant, useful, and easy to interact with. Examples of promotions that don't meet these editorial and professional requirements (non-exhaustive): overly generic ads that contain vague phrases such as \"Buy products here\"; gimmicky use of words, numbers, letters, punctuation, or symbols such as FREE, f-r-e-e, and F₹€€!! Destination requirements We want consumers to have a good experience when they click on an ad, so ad destinations must offer unique value to users and be functional, useful, and easy to navigate. Examples of promotions that don't meet destination requirements (non-exhaustive): Display URLs that don’t accurately reflect the URL of the landing page, sites or apps that are under construction; sites that aren’t viewable in commonly used browsers; sites that have disabled the browser’s back button Technical requirements In order to provide an engaging user experience, Google requires that all ads, assets, and destinations meet certain technical requirements to make sure your ads are useful and appealing. Ads must be clear, functional, and lead users to content that is relevant and easy to interact with. Examples of promotions that don't meet technical requirements (non-exhaustive): exceeding account limits for ads and other content; ads or destination content in an unsupported targeting language; HTML5 ads that don’t function properly or appear blank Ad format requirements In order to help you provide a quality user experience and deliver attractive, professional-looking ads, we only allow ads that comply with specific requirements for each ad format. Review the requirements for all ad formats that you're using. We don't allow Non-family safe ads in image ads, video ads, and other non-text ad formats. Learn more about our Sexual content policy. Advertisers participating in beta programs of new ad formats should reach out to their Google Ads representatives or Google Ads customer support to learn about format-specific policy requirements. Examples of ad format requirements (non-exhaustive): character limits for the ad headline or body, image size requirements, file size limits, video length limits, aspect ratios About our policies Google Ads enables businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network. Google requires that advertisers comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us. Advertisers have a responsibility not to promote content or engage in behavior that risks harm to our users, employees, or the Ads ecosystem. If we see such content or behavior, we may take action, including but not limited to restricting or blocking your ads or suspending your account. Need help?

Online advertising can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate. For that reason, we allow the promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and advertisers may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all ad products, features, or networks are able to support this restricted content. Further details can be found in the Policy Manager.

Examples of restricted alcoholic beverages (non-exhaustive): beer, wine, sake, spirits or hard alcohol, Champagne, fortified wine, non-alcoholic beer, non-alcoholic wine, non-alcoholic distilled spirits Copyrights We abide by local copyright laws and protect the rights of copyright holders, so we don’t allow ads that are unauthorized to use copyrighted content. If you are legally authorized to use copyrighted content, apply for certification (or here for DV360) to advertise. If you see unauthorized content, submit a copyright-related complaint. Examples of restricted copyrighted content (non-exhaustive): sites or apps that facilitate unauthorized offline distribution of copyrighted content; unauthorized sites or software that capture, copy, or provide access to copyrighted content Gambling and games We support responsible gambling advertising and abide by local gambling laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of gambling-related advertising. Gambling-related ads are allowed if they comply with the policies below and the advertiser has received the proper Google Ads certification. Gambling ads must target approved countries, have a landing page that displays information about responsible gambling, and never target minors. Check local regulations for the areas you want to target. Examples of restricted gambling-related content (non-exhaustive): physical casinos; sites where users can bet on poker, bingo, roulette, or sports events; national or private lotteries; sports odds aggregator sites; sites offering bonus codes or promotional offers for gambling sites; online educational materials for casino-based games; sites offering \"poker-for-fun\" games; non-casino-based cash game sites Healthcare and medicines We're dedicated to following advertising regulations for healthcare and medicine, so we expect that ads and destinations follow appropriate laws and industry standards. Some healthcare-related content can’t be advertised at all, while others can only be advertised if the advertiser is certified with Google and targets only approved locations. Check local regulations for the locations you want to target. For most healthcare policies, if your ad campaign targets allowed locations and the domain is properly certified, your ad will be labeled “Eligible (limited)” and can run in allowed locations. Examples of restricted healthcare content (non-exhaustive): clinical trial recruitment; HIV home tests; addiction services; prescription drug services Political content We support responsible political advertising and expect all political ads and destinations to comply with local campaign and election laws for any areas they target. This policy includes legally mandated election “silence periods.” Examples of political content (non-exhaustive): promotion of political parties or candidates, political issue advocacy Financial products and services We want users to have adequate information to make informed financial decisions. Our policies are designed to give users information to weigh the costs associated with financial products and services, and to protect users from harmful or deceitful practices. For the purposes of this policy, we consider financial products and services to be those related to the management or investment of money and cryptocurrencies, including personalized advice. When promoting financial products and services, you must comply with state and local regulations for any location that your ads target — for example, include specific disclosures required by local law. Advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Below you can find policy requirements related to financial services, personal loans, and certain restricted financial products. As the online advertising and regulatory space continues to evolve, we'll update this policy with additional product-specific guidelines on an ongoing basis.

Examples of restricted Financial products and services (non-exhaustive): personal loans, loan modification, credit repair services Cryptocurrencies and related products Due to the complex and evolving nature of regulations related to cryptocurrencies and related products and services, we allow certain categories of cryptocurrency-related products and services to be advertised with and without certification by Google in limited circumstances. While most advertisers must be certified by Google, there may be limited circumstances where certification is not required. Examples of cryptocurrency businesses that may not require certification (non-exhaustive): businesses accepting payment in cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency mining hardware, NFT games that allow players to purchase in-game items, like virtual apparel for a player’s characters, consumed or used in a game to enhance a user’s experience or aid users in advancing the game. Examples of cryptocurrency businesses that require certification (non-exhaustive): cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, cryptocurrency coin trusts When promoting cryptocurrencies and related products, you must comply with state and local regulations for any region or country that your ads target. Refer to our non-exhaustive list of location-specific requirements for more information but note that advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Trademarks There are multiple factors that determine when trademarks can be used in ads. Along with the factors described in our Policy Center, these policies apply only when a trademark owner has submitted a valid complaint to Google. Legal requirements You’re always responsible for ensuring that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations, in addition to Google's advertising policies, for all of the locations where your ads are showing. Other restricted businesses We restrict certain businesses from advertising to prevent user exploitation, even if they comply with other policies. Continuous reviews and feedback from users, regulators, and consumer protection authorities help us identify products or services that are prone to abuse. We may limit or stop ads from businesses that pose an unreasonable risk to user safety or experience. Restricted ad formats and features There are multiple factors that determine access to advanced ad formats and features on Google Ads. Certain ad formats are not available for all advertisers until they meet our specific requirements or complete the certification process. Limited ad serving To protect the integrity of our Google Ads ecosystem, we limit impressions of ads that have a higher potential of causing abuse or a poor experience for our users. In these specific instances, only qualified advertisers will be able to serve ads without impression limits. Learn more about when limited ad serving applies and who is a qualified advertiser. Editorial and technical requirements We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users. We've also specified technical requirements to help users and advertisers get the most out of the variety of ad formats we offer. Editorial In order to provide a quality user experience, Google requires that all ads, assets, and destinations meet high professional and editorial standards. We only allow ads that are clear, professional in appearance, and that lead users to content that is relevant, useful, and easy to interact with. Examples of promotions that don't meet these editorial and professional requirements (non-exhaustive): overly generic ads that contain vague phrases such as \"Buy products here\"; gimmicky use of words, numbers, letters, punctuation, or symbols such as FREE, f-r-e-e, and F₹€€!! Destination requirements We want consumers to have a good experience when they click on an ad, so ad destinations must offer unique value to users and be functional, useful, and easy to navigate. Examples of promotions that don't meet destination requirements (non-exhaustive): Display URLs that don’t accurately reflect the URL of the landing page, sites or apps that are under construction; sites that aren’t viewable in commonly used browsers; sites that have disabled the browser’s back button Technical requirements In order to provide an engaging user experience, Google requires that all ads, assets, and destinations meet certain technical requirements to make sure your ads are useful and appealing. Ads must be clear, functional, and lead users to content that is relevant and easy to interact with. Examples of promotions that don't meet technical requirements (non-exhaustive): exceeding account limits for ads and other content; ads or destination content in an unsupported targeting language; HTML5 ads that don’t function properly or appear blank Ad format requirements In order to help you provide a quality user experience and deliver attractive, professional-looking ads, we only allow ads that comply with specific requirements for each ad format. Review the requirements for all ad formats that you're using. We don't allow Non-family safe ads in image ads, video ads, and other non-text ad formats. Learn more about our Sexual content policy. Advertisers participating in beta programs of new ad formats should reach out to their Google Ads representatives or Google Ads customer support to learn about format-specific policy requirements. Examples of ad format requirements (non-exhaustive): character limits for the ad headline or body, image size requirements, file size limits, video length limits, aspect ratios About our policies Google Ads enables businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products, services, applications, and websites on Google and across our network. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on the Google Network. Google requires that advertisers comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Google policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us. Advertisers have a responsibility not to promote content or engage in behavior that risks harm to our users, employees, or the Ads ecosystem. If we see such content or behavior, we may take action, including but not limited to restricting or blocking your ads or suspending your account. Need help?

If you fail to comply with these policies without permission from Google, we reserve the right to disable ad serving to your site and/or disable your AdSense account at any time. If your account is disabled, you will not be eligible for further participation in the AdSense program. Because we may change our policies at any time, please check here often for updates. In accordance with our online Terms and Conditions, it's your responsibility to keep up to date with, and adhere to, the policies posted here. Exceptions to these policies are permitted only with authorization from Google. Publishers may place AdSense code on pages with content in scope of the Google Publisher Restrictions, though this content will likely receive less advertising than other, nonrestricted content. Expand all Collapse all Invalid clicks and impressions Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods. Learn more Clicks on Google ads must result from genuine user interest. Any method that artificially generates clicks or impressions on your Google ads is strictly prohibited. These prohibited methods include, but are not limited to, repeated manual clicks or impressions, automated click and impression generating tools and the use of robots or deceptive software. Please note that clicking your own ads for any reason is prohibited. Encouraging clicks or views (non-rewarded inventory) Except for rewarded inventory, publishers may not ask others to click or view their ads or use deceptive implementation methods to obtain clicks or views. This includes, but is not limited to, offering compensation to users for viewing ads or performing searches, promising to raise money for third parties for such behavior or placing images next to individual ads. Learn more To ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, publishers participating in the AdSense program may not: Compensate users for viewing ads or performing searches, or promise compensation to a third party for such behavior. Encourage users to click the Google ads using phrases such as \"click the ads\", \"support us\", \"visit these links\" or other similar language. Direct user attention to the ads using arrows or other graphical gimmicks. Place misleading images alongside individual ads. Place ads in a floating box script. Format ads so that they become indistinguishable from other content on that page. Format site content so that it is difficult to distinguish it from ads. Place misleading labels above Google ad units. For instance, ads may be labelled \"Sponsored Links\" or \"Advertisements\", but not \"Favorite Sites\" or \"Today's Top Offers\". Traffic sources Google ads may not be placed on pages receiving traffic from certain sources. For example, publishers may not participate in paid-to-click programs, send unwanted emails or display ads as the result of the action of any software application. Also, publishers using online advertising must ensure that their pages comply with Google's Landing Page Quality Guidelines. Learn more To ensure a positive experience for Internet users and Google advertisers, sites displaying Google ads may not: Use third-party services that generate clicks or impressions such as paid-to-click, paid-to-surf, autosurf and click-exchange programs. Be promoted through unsolicited mass emails or unwanted advertisements on third-party websites. Display Google ads, search boxes or search results as a result of the actions of software applications such as toolbars. Be loaded by any software that can trigger pop-ups, redirect users to unwanted websites, modify browser settings or otherwise interfere with site navigation. It is your responsibility to ensure that no ad network or affiliate uses such methods to direct traffic to pages that contain your AdSense code. Receive traffic from online advertising unless the site complies with the spirit of Google's Landing Page Quality Guidelines. For instance, users should easily be able to find what your ad promises. Ad behavior Publishers are permitted to make modifications to the AdSense ad code so long as those modifications do not artificially inflate ad performance or harm advertisers. Please see modification of the AdSense ad code for more information. Ad placement Publishers are encouraged to experiment with a variety of placements and ad formats. However, AdSense code may not be placed in inappropriate places such as pop-ups, emails or software. Publishers must also adhere to the policies for each product used. Please see our ad placement policies article for more information. View full ad placement policies. Google ads, search boxes or search results may not be: Integrated into a software application (does not apply to AdMob) of any kind, including toolbars. Displayed in pop-ups or pop-unders, including where a page containing Google ads, search boxes, or search results is loaded in a pop-up or pop-under. Placed inside emails, or on pages where email messages are the primary focus. Placed on screens where private communication is the primary focus of the page. Placed on any non-content-based page. (Does not apply to AdSense for search or mobile AdSense for search.) Placed on pages published specifically for the purpose of showing ads. Placed on pages whose content or URL could confuse users into thinking it is associated with Google due to the misuse of logos, trademarks or other brand features. Placed on, within or alongside other Google products or services in a manner that violates the policies of that product or service. Placed on pages that frame content. Framing content is when a site or app displays someone’s else site within a frame or window without permission from the owners of that content. Site behavior Sites showing Google ads should be easy for users to navigate. Sites may not change user preferences, redirect users to unwanted websites, initiate downloads, include malware or contain pop-ups or pop-unders that interfere with site navigation. Deceptive site navigation Publishers may not use deceptive implementation methods that place ads in a way that might be mistaken for menu, navigation or download links to obtain clicks or views. Keep in mind that every publisher is responsible to ensure that their ad implementation adheres to the ad placement policies. This includes, but is not limited to: False claims of streaming content, or downloads Linking to content that doesn’t exist Redirecting users to irrelevant, or misleading webpages Other types of navigation that is designed to intentionally mislead users Pages where ads are implemented in placements that are intuitively meant for navigation. Technical requirements for web content viewing frames for apps App developers who want to monetize by publishing AdSense and Ad Manager display ads through a web content viewing frame must use one of the following integration options: WebView API for Ads App developers are encouraged to integrate the WebView API for Ads to register WebView instances (Android: WebView, iOS: WKWebView) with Google Mobile Ads SDK. Learn more in the developer documentation for Androidand iOS. AdMob and Ad Manager in-app ads may be shown in an app next to a WebView as long as the Google Mobile Ads SDK is in use and the publisher is compliant with all other relevant program policies and guidelines. As a reminder, content in the WebView is subject to the same content policy requirement as when it is in a browser. Other supported viewing frames: Android: Chrome Custom Tabs and Trusted Web Activities iOS: SFSafariViewController (iOS9 and iOS10 only) Sensitive events A \"Sensitive Event\" is an unforeseen event or development that creates significant risk to Google's ability to provide high quality, relevant information and ground truth, and reduce insensitive or exploitative content in prominent and monetized features. During a sensitive event, we may take a variety of actions to address these risks.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the Display & Video 360 help center for additional restrictions. In this article About the policy Report an ad Best practices Appeal policy decision Google Ads prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods are products that contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark of another. They mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner. This policy applies to the content of your ad and your website or app. The following is not allowed: Products described using terms like knock off, replica, imitation, clone, faux, fake, mirror image, or similar terms when referring to a brand name in an attempt to pass themselves off as genuine products of the brand owner Non-genuine products that mimic brand features in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product Examples (non-exhaustive): Non-authentic products that have brand name labels or logos Learn more about What happens if you violate our policies. Violations of this policy are taken very seriously and are considered egregious. An egregious violation of the Google Ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users. In determining whether an advertiser or destination is violating this policy, Google may review information from multiple sources including your ad, website, accounts, and third-party sources. If violations of this policy are found, your Google Ads accounts will be suspended upon detection and without prior warning, and you will not be allowed to advertise with Google Ads again. If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy, submit an appeal and explain why. Accounts are only reinstated in compelling circumstances, and when there is good reason so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest. Learn more about suspended accounts. Report an ad If you think an ad or advertiser is violating this policy, you can report the content through the Google Ads Counterfeit complaint form. Google’s response to a valid counterfeit complaint may include removing the content or terminating the user’s account for this Google product. Google Ads may also document complaints that we take action on by sending copies to third parties or making them available to the public. If your complaint pertains to multiple Google products, please submit a separate counterfeit complaint for each product, using the relevant product's form. Best practices Be clear about your partnerships: If you're an official or authorized re-seller for another brand or multiple other brands, make your relationship clear on your own website and ads. If you reference another brand but you're not an official or authorized partner, consider a disclaimer on your website and in your ads. Use your own branding: Use your own name, logo, images, and brand colors on your website and in your ads. Avoid using another brand’s identity in a misleading way: Avoid using another brand’s name, logo, images, and colors in ways that can trick people. Don’t misspell another brand’s name in your ad text, like “G00gle”. When referencing another brand, follow Google’s policy on trademarks. Appeal policy decision If you believe there’s been an error, appeal the policy decision directly from your Google Ads account to request a review. After confirming that your content complies with policy, your ads will be allowed to serve. If you aren't able to fix these violations or choose not to, remove your ad to help prevent your account from becoming suspended in the future for repeated policy violations. Need help?

An egregious violation of the Google Ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users. In determining whether an advertiser or destination is violating this policy, Google may review information from multiple sources including your ad, website, accounts, and third-party sources. If violations of this policy are found, your Google Ads accounts will be suspended upon detection and without prior warning, and you will not be allowed to advertise with Google Ads again. If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy, submit an appeal and explain why. Accounts are only reinstated in compelling circumstances, and when there is good reason so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest.

Claims related to health and weight loss Making unproven claims of cures for incurable medical ailments Google Ads may defer to local regulatory guidelines for health-related claims, including testimonial content, when enforcing this policy.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Google Ads Circumventing Systems Policy Explained (Avoid Suspension) For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon at the bottom of the video player, then select \"Subtitles/CC\" and choose your language. Ads across the Google Network should be useful, varied, relevant, and safe for users. Google Ads doesn't allow advertisers to attempt to trick or circumvent our ad review processes with their ads, content, or destinations. Learn more about the Abusing the ad network policy. Violations of this policy are taken very seriously and are considered egregious. An egregious violation of the Google Ads policies is a violation so serious that it is unlawful or poses significant harm to our users. In determining whether an advertiser or destination is violating this policy, Google may review information from multiple sources including your ad, website, accounts, and third-party sources. If violations of this policy are found, your Google Ads accounts will be suspended upon detection and without prior warning, and you will not be allowed to advertise with Google Ads again. If you believe there's been an error, and that you haven’t violated our policy, submit an appeal and explain why. Accounts are only reinstated in compelling circumstances, and when there is good reason so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest. Learn more about suspended accounts. In this article Circumventing systems Cloaking Multiple account abuse Fix your suspended account Circumventing systems The following is not allowed: Engaging in practices that circumvent or interfere with Google's advertising systems and processes, or attempting to do so Examples (non-exhaustive): Bypassing enforcement mechanisms and detection by creating variations of ads, domains or content that have been disapproved for this or any Google Ads policy or using techniques in text, images or videos to obfuscate sexually explicit content After a previous suspension decision, attempting to use the Google Ads system again by creating new accounts to re-enter the system Abusing Google Ads product features to show policy non-compliant content to users or gain additional traffic Submitting false information as part of our verification programs Having multiple ad policy violations across several of your accounts gradually or all at once. This can include: Creating new websites or accounts to show ads that are similar to ones that were already disapproved Spreading ads that violate Google Ads' policies across 2 or more accounts Using several accounts, either gradually or all at once, to promote products or services for which you lack the necessary Google Ads certifications As part of Google Ads' Gambling and games certification program, failing to re-certify or continuing to use the Gambling and games certification if a material change has occurred since the last certification application was submitted. Material changes are considered to be major, substantial or relevant changes to your account. Google Ads understands that your address or payment method may change periodically. Failing to resubmit your Gambling and games certification application after one of these 2 types of changes will not lead to account suspension. Other material changes do require resubmission of the Gambling and games certification application or your account will be suspended upon detection. These material changes include, but are not limited to, changes to your product offerings that are inconsistent with any license or approvals provided to Google, changes to your compliance with applicable regulations, and changes to your licensure or other compliance with the Gambling and games certification requirements. Your account may be suspended based on adverse regulatory warnings, settlements, or rulings about your advertising practices or direct complaints from users or businesses. Accounts aren't suspended under this policy for having ad disapprovals related to editorial issues like formatting or misspelled words. Circumventing systems: Cloaking Cloaking isn’t allowed under the circumventing systems policy. “Cloaking” refers to showing different content on your website to different people or to Google to try to hide things that might break Google Ads' rules. It's okay to show slightly different content to different people, like showing a landing page or ad destination in different languages, having different special offers, or adjusting for geographical location or slower internet speeds, but the promoted product or service needs to be the same for everyone. Using appropriate click trackers and redirecting users is okay as long as you’re not doing these things to try to hide that you’re showing or doing anything that goes against Google Ads' policies. Examples (non-exhaustive): Showing Google a landing page or an ad's destination that complies with Google Ads' policies while showing people different content. For example, showing sale of clothing to Google when the website sells guns. A pop-up, also known as an “intrusive interstitial” that blocks access to the majority of your website’s content, meaning Google cannot access your landing page or ad's destination to determine whether it’s prohibited Tricking people into clicking on your ad by promoting a topic they’re interested in and then leading them to a website for an entirely different topic, while hiding this inconsistency from Google and its crawlers Sending users to a completely different website that violates Google Ads' policies, even if it’s within the same domain Using click trackers, which are tools that measure how many people click a link, to redirect people to websites with content prohibited by Google Ads' policies Why this isn’t allowed It's misleading: People might see unexpected content that isn’t allowed by Google Ads on your destination, which can be frustrating. It can hide problems: Cloaking can be used to hide content that isn’t allowed under Google Ads’ policies. Best practices (non-exhaustive) Show policy-compliant content: Make sure you're not sending people to websites or content that violate Google Ads' policies while showing Google something different. Allow easy access: Make sure Google can easily see all the pages on your website (for developers: Google’s common crawlers). Use certified click trackers: If you're using a click tracker, make sure to use one that’s certified by Google. Do a security check: Websites can get hacked and cloaking content can be added without you knowing. You can use the Safe Browsing tool to check if your website is safe (this might not catch everything, but it's a good place to start). Tips for submitting your appeal Follow best practices: Implement the best practices provided if you haven’t already. Explain your situation: Provide details about why you were showing different content to Google than to other people. If there’s been a mistake, share the steps you took to make sure cloaking isn’t happening on your website, like removing redirections or getting certified to advertise restricted content. Circumventing systems: Multiple account abuse Multiple account abuse isn’t allowed under the circumventing systems policy. This means you can’t create multiple Google Ads accounts after getting suspended to try to get around Google Ads' policies or show content that breaks Google Ads' rules. Examples (non-exhaustive): Creating more accounts after getting suspended in order to continue breaking Google’s policies Creating dozens of accounts to run a scam, such as directing users to a fake business that tricks them into buying goods they won’t receive Why this isn’t allowed It can be harmful: Accounts are suspended to create a safe and positive experience for users. It has been used to attempt to evade policy enforcement: Everyone needs to follow the same Google Ads policies. Attempting to use multiple accounts to get around those policies is not allowed. Best practices Limit bulk account creation: Avoid creating a lot of accounts in a short period of time, including by using different email addresses to open the accounts. Connect accounts to real businesses: If you have multiple advertising accounts, make sure each account is connected to a real business. Use trusted payment methods: If you have multiple advertising accounts, make sure each account uses a safe payment method. Resolve suspensions: If you're connected to other accounts that have been suspended, those suspensions need to be successfully reinstated through the appeal process. Check with your agency: If you work with an agency or someone else who manages your account, reach out to them about this suspension. Tips for submitting your appeal Follow best practices: Implement the best practices provided here if you haven’t already. Explain your situation: Provide details about why you have multiple accounts. If you were connected to other accounts that were suspended, share how you resolved those issues. If there’s been a mistake, explain what happened. Complete verification: Complete all tasks required for advertiser verification if requested. Fix your suspended account If you believe there’s been an error and that you haven’t violated Google Ads' policies, submit an appeal. In your Google Ads account, click the Contact Us link in the notification at the top of your screen. This link will direct you to the appeal form on the right side of your screen. While you complete the form, relevant policy information will appear to help you understand the reason for the suspension and the appeal process. If you select Contact Us again while your appeal is still being processed, your Google Ads account will have an “Appeal pending” status. When your appeal is reviewed, you'll receive an email with the outcome. If your appeal is rejected, you can re-appeal following the same process outlined above. Certain selected advertisers must complete advertiser verification successfully to appeal their account suspension. If Google isn't able to verify their identity after 3 attempts, they won't be allowed to appeal their account suspension. Advertisers suspended for Billing and Payment suspensions may be asked to verify their payment method to process their appeals. Accounts are only reinstated in compelling circumstances, such as in the case of a mistake, so it's important that you take the time to be thorough, accurate, and honest.

The English version is the official language used to enforce Google Ads policies. To view this article in a different language, use the language dropdown at the bottom of the page. Display & Video 360 users must comply with this Google Ads policy. Visit the Display & Video 360 help center for additional restrictions. Learn more about the “Eligible (Limited)” status. We support responsible political advertising, and expect all political ads and destinations to comply with legal requirements. This includes campaign and election laws and mandated election “silence periods\" for any geographic areas they target. Google has different requirements for political and election advertising based on region. In some regions, election ads may run only if the advertiser is verified by Google. In these regions, election ads are subject to disclosure requirements and targeting restrictions; see below for additional information. Google Ad Grants accounts are not eligible to run election ads or apply for election ads verification in these regions. Check the information under the applicable regional heading for verification and restriction information. In other regions, there are restrictions on political ads. See below for a list of these regions and what is prohibited. There may be additional prohibitions or requirements listed in the legal requirements policy. If your ads contain political content that is not restricted here or by the legal requirements for a given region, your ads may run as long as they are compliant with all other Google Ads policies and local laws and regulations. Non-compliance with our political content policies may result in information about your account and political ads being disclosed publicly or to relevant government agencies and regulators.

If you fail to comply with these policies without permission from Google, we reserve the right to disable ad serving to your site and/or disable your AdSense account at any time. If your account is disabled, you will not be eligible for further participation in the AdSense program. Because we may change our policies at any time, please check here often for updates. In accordance with our online Terms and Conditions, it's your responsibility to keep up to date with, and adhere to, the policies posted here. Exceptions to these policies are permitted only with authorization from Google. Publishers may place AdSense code on pages with content in scope of the Google Publisher Restrictions, though this content will likely receive less advertising than other, nonrestricted content. Expand all Collapse all Invalid clicks and impressions Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods. Learn more Clicks on Google ads must result from genuine user interest. Any method that artificially generates clicks or impressions on your Google ads is strictly prohibited. These prohibited methods include, but are not limited to, repeated manual clicks or impressions, automated click and impression generating tools and the use of robots or deceptive software. Please note that clicking your own ads for any reason is prohibited. Encouraging clicks or views (non-rewarded inventory) Except for rewarded inventory, publishers may not ask others to click or view their ads or use deceptive implementation methods to obtain clicks or views. This includes, but is not limited to, offering compensation to users for viewing ads or performing searches, promising to raise money for third parties for such behavior or placing images next to individual ads. Learn more To ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, publishers participating in the AdSense program may not: Compensate users for viewing ads or performing searches, or promise compensation to a third party for such behavior. Encourage users to click the Google ads using phrases such as \"click the ads\", \"support us\", \"visit these links\" or other similar language. Direct user attention to the ads using arrows or other graphical gimmicks. Place misleading images alongside individual ads. Place ads in a floating box script. Format ads so that they become indistinguishable from other content on that page. Format site content so that it is difficult to distinguish it from ads. Place misleading labels above Google ad units. For instance, ads may be labelled \"Sponsored Links\" or \"Advertisements\", but not \"Favorite Sites\" or \"Today's Top Offers\". Traffic sources Google ads may not be placed on pages receiving traffic from certain sources. For example, publishers may not participate in paid-to-click programs, send unwanted emails or display ads as the result of the action of any software application. Also, publishers using online advertising must ensure that their pages comply with Google's Landing Page Quality Guidelines. Learn more To ensure a positive experience for Internet users and Google advertisers, sites displaying Google ads may not: Use third-party services that generate clicks or impressions such as paid-to-click, paid-to-surf, autosurf and click-exchange programs. Be promoted through unsolicited mass emails or unwanted advertisements on third-party websites. Display Google ads, search boxes or search results as a result of the actions of software applications such as toolbars. Be loaded by any software that can trigger pop-ups, redirect users to unwanted websites, modify browser settings or otherwise interfere with site navigation. It is your responsibility to ensure that no ad network or affiliate uses such methods to direct traffic to pages that contain your AdSense code. Receive traffic from online advertising unless the site complies with the spirit of Google's Landing Page Quality Guidelines. For instance, users should easily be able to find what your ad promises. Ad behavior Publishers are permitted to make modifications to the AdSense ad code so long as those modifications do not artificially inflate ad performance or harm advertisers. Please see modification of the AdSense ad code for more information. Ad placement Publishers are encouraged to experiment with a variety of placements and ad formats. However, AdSense code may not be placed in inappropriate places such as pop-ups, emails or software. Publishers must also adhere to the policies for each product used. Please see our ad placement policies article for more information. View full ad placement policies. Google ads, search boxes or search results may not be: Integrated into a software application (does not apply to AdMob) of any kind, including toolbars. Displayed in pop-ups or pop-unders, including where a page containing Google ads, search boxes, or search results is loaded in a pop-up or pop-under. Placed inside emails, or on pages where email messages are the primary focus. Placed on screens where private communication is the primary focus of the page. Placed on any non-content-based page. (Does not apply to AdSense for search or mobile AdSense for search.) Placed on pages published specifically for the purpose of showing ads. Placed on pages whose content or URL could confuse users into thinking it is associated with Google due to the misuse of logos, trademarks or other brand features. Placed on, within or alongside other Google products or services in a manner that violates the policies of that product or service. Placed on pages that frame content. Framing content is when a site or app displays someone’s else site within a frame or window without permission from the owners of that content. Site behavior Sites showing Google ads should be easy for users to navigate. Sites may not change user preferences, redirect users to unwanted websites, initiate downloads, include malware or contain pop-ups or pop-unders that interfere with site navigation. Deceptive site navigation Publishers may not use deceptive implementation methods that place ads in a way that might be mistaken for menu, navigation or download links to obtain clicks or views. Keep in mind that every publisher is responsible to ensure that their ad implementation adheres to the ad placement policies. This includes, but is not limited to: False claims of streaming content, or downloads Linking to content that doesn’t exist Redirecting users to irrelevant, or misleading webpages Other types of navigation that is designed to intentionally mislead users Pages where ads are implemented in placements that are intuitively meant for navigation. Technical requirements for web content viewing frames for apps App developers who want to monetize by publishing AdSense and Ad Manager display ads through a web content viewing frame must use one of the following integration options: WebView API for Ads App developers are encouraged to integrate the WebView API for Ads to register WebView instances (Android: WebView, iOS: WKWebView) with Google Mobile Ads SDK. Learn more in the developer documentation for Androidand iOS. AdMob and Ad Manager in-app ads may be shown in an app next to a WebView as long as the Google Mobile Ads SDK is in use and the publisher is compliant with all other relevant program policies and guidelines. As a reminder, content in the WebView is subject to the same content policy requirement as when it is in a browser. Other supported viewing frames: Android: Chrome Custom Tabs and Trusted Web Activities iOS: SFSafariViewController (iOS9 and iOS10 only) Sensitive events A \"Sensitive Event\" is an unforeseen event or development that creates significant risk to Google's ability to provide high quality, relevant information and ground truth, and reduce insensitive or exploitative content in prominent and monetized features. During a sensitive event, we may take a variety of actions to address these risks.

If you fail to comply with these policies without permission from Google, we reserve the right to disable ad serving to your site and/or disable your AdSense account at any time. If your account is disabled, you will not be eligible for further participation in the AdSense program. Because we may change our policies at any time, please check here often for updates. In accordance with our online Terms and Conditions, it's your responsibility to keep up to date with, and adhere to, the policies posted here. Exceptions to these policies are permitted only with authorization from Google. Publishers may place AdSense code on pages with content in scope of the Google Publisher Restrictions, though this content will likely receive less advertising than other, nonrestricted content. Expand all Collapse all Invalid clicks and impressions Publishers may not click their own ads or use any means to inflate impressions and/or clicks artificially, including manual methods. Learn more Clicks on Google ads must result from genuine user interest. Any method that artificially generates clicks or impressions on your Google ads is strictly prohibited. These prohibited methods include, but are not limited to, repeated manual clicks or impressions, automated click and impression generating tools and the use of robots or deceptive software. Please note that clicking your own ads for any reason is prohibited. Encouraging clicks or views (non-rewarded inventory) Except for rewarded inventory, publishers may not ask others to click or view their ads or use deceptive implementation methods to obtain clicks or views. This includes, but is not limited to, offering compensation to users for viewing ads or performing searches, promising to raise money for third parties for such behavior or placing images next to individual ads. Learn more To ensure a good experience for users and advertisers, publishers participating in the AdSense program may not: Compensate users for viewing ads or performing searches, or promise compensation to a third party for such behavior.
